				<p><strong>Location</strong>: Reims</p>
<p>I woke up and had coffee in the airbnb. That was a delightful way to start the
day. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting going back to camping, albeit for only one
night.</p>
<p>I started considering my next residence after this bike trip. I was planning
on Warsaw / Krakow, but actually a month rental in Paris is under 1000EUR,
and pretty centrally located. It&rsquo;s definitely something to consider, but the
cost of everything will be a lot more &ndash; probably 2-3x more than Poland. Just
the airbnb rental in warsaw is half of the cost of one in Paris, not even
considering food and beer.</p>
<p>But living in Paris for a month is taking root. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll just do both.</p>
<p>My route tomorrow looks long. Train from Reims to Charleville-Mézière, then a
local ardenne train to Fumay &ndash; from there I am on an international bike
route to Gedinne (where Bert lives, will say hi and maybe grab lunch?), then
off to the bivouac campsite, Bivak Bois de Bané. 60km all told, well within
my range, and mostly flat after the initial elevation gain/drop when crossing
from France back into Belgium.</p>
<p>We had a fairly chill Sunday. We started with beer and poutine at Les 3
Brasseurs. The poutine was good but not actually poutine &ndash; it was fries with
shredded bbq beef on top, and a melted mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses.
The beer was fine. The blonde was a blonde, but the IPA was definitely a
European IPA. Low on bitterness, and with a flavor that disappears real
quick.</p>
<p>We had a champagne tasting that we had to arrive for between 14:00 and 16:30.
Still before 13:00, we headed to the cathedral to check it out. I found the
architecture very nice, and the size super impressive.</p>

<p>Out front there were
two stone tablets inlaid in the ground before the cathedral entrance. They
signified the start of reconciliation between france and germany. 1962, 17
years after Berlin surrendered, and very close to when the berlin wall went
up.</p>

</div>
<p>We walked on to Basilique Saint-Remy. Older, less impressive, but still cool.
Literally and figuratively. Although it was only 28C outside, it was hot out
on the street in pants and a flannel (flannel was the only non-under armour
option I had on the trip).</p>
<p>The champagne tasting was at Domaine Vranken Pommery. The place was huge, but
we were only allowed into a single sort of entrance hall. Reception on the
left when you enter, exit through the gift shop on the right. In front of us
was a massive room with some art, a few sofas, and massive display barrels on
the wall to the right.</p>
<p>We headed for the cellar. We descended old stairs, the middle of the step
worn away by all the feet from the past 200 years.</p>
<p>Lights lined the handrails. They were programmed to strobe up and down the
length of the ~80m stairway. This struck me as odd.</p>
<p>As we moved from dank dark room to dank dark room, it dawned on me that this
was an art installation with some champagne bottles lying around, and not
(really) a champagne cellar that had some art here and there.</p>
<p>Rooms for storing champagne were named by cities or areas &ndash; Zürich, Munich,
Manchester, Île-de-France. This was ostensibly for organization and not
actually denoting the bottles' intended destination.</p>
<p>These rooms were connected by a long arched hallway. The hallway was lined
with cubic stacks of dusty champagne bottles, stacked on their sides and set
atop eachother alternating cork-facing-out and cork-facing-in to stack the
bottles more tightly. The stacks were to about waist height. High up on one
side where the wall meets the ceiling a long rope pulley ran the length of
the hall. Wicker baskets for moving bottles were spaced every meter or so
along the rope.</p>
<p>There were massive square topped pyramidal chambers for aging champagne,
easily 60m high. The temperature year round is about 10C, and the air is
damp. Each chamber had some piece of art in it. The art was unsettling (or
maybe it was just the berlin club-esque atmosphere), but I enjoyed it
immensely.</p>
<p>After wandering in the gloom we ascended the stairs to the light and drank
some champagne.</p>
<p>We returned to the main area in the city and visited the Porte de Mars and
walked down the main cafe/restaurant street.</p>
<p>This and the champagne cellar made the whole day feel surreal. Walking in the
cellar with the lights and art and dark felt like being in some sort of
disneyland haunted mansion. Returning to the city, with its single populated
street full of people in cafes and deserted intersecting side streets,
completed the &ldquo;France-land&rdquo; disney vibe. It had all the things to be french
but felt staged or counterfeit.</p>

</div>
<p>We sat at the cafe hemingway and drank beer and talked. Etienne is
freelancing, so we semi-joked about freelancing together. Relaxing in paris
for a bit doing some side work to afford a nicer bottle of wine with dinner
sounds pretty good. Maybe i&rsquo;ll start october in Poland, head back to berlin
for my birthday, then go to paris until it&rsquo;s time to visit Alex for
christmas. I just need to keep an eye on quarantine restrictions for heading
back to Berlin from Paris. Poland, as of this writing, has no quarantine
restrictions.</p>
<p>We drank and ate. It was a good end to the day.</p>
