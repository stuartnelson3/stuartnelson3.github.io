			<p><strong>Location:</strong> Charleville-Mézière -&gt; Reims</p>
<p>First, Reims is pronounced like &ldquo;Raas&rdquo;. Or so. Knowing that would have been
helpful when telling people where I was going. &ldquo;Remmes&rdquo;, as I had been
pronouncing it, does not exist.</p>
<p>I had a very slow start to the day. My bus to Reims left at 15:27, and there
wasn&rsquo;t much going on in CM on a saturday morning.</p>
<p>The bus to Reims was uneventful. I listened to, for the umpteenth time, Colour
Haze&rsquo;s self-titled album. It was as always a treat.</p>
<p>I met up with Etienne, whom I haven&rsquo;t seen in probably over a year. We had a
bottle of Champagne and caught up. He&rsquo;s been unemployed living on the french
island Réunion with his doctor girlfriend (Marine, who directed me to Revin and
the voie verte). That&rsquo;s actually where he was for lockdown. He&rsquo;s since returned
to Paris and is freelancing.</p>
<p>We grabbed crepes for dinner (bien sûr), drank cidre and beer, and continued to
shoot the breeze. It was really great to catch up.</p>
<p>I slept in a bed for the first time in almost two weeks. It was nice.</p>
<h2 id="side-reflection">Side Reflection</h2>
<p>I started reading &ldquo;a moveable feast&rdquo;. I read &ldquo;a farewell to arms&rdquo; (sort of) in
highschool but don&rsquo;t remember it, and having read &ldquo;men without women&rdquo; earlier
in the trip, I&rsquo;m not wholly unfamiliar with his style. I&rsquo;ve also seen &ldquo;midnight
in paris&rdquo; several times. His character was the scene-stealing highlight for me,
and his character never got overused, and I&rsquo;m appreciating him even more now.</p>
<p>The subject in &ldquo;a moveable feast&rdquo; is fairly mundane. Compared to, for example,
the absolutely gripping opening story in &ldquo;men without women&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s pretty dull.
Hemingway drinks. Hemingway gambles. He scribbles a bit. The prose is what I
find so engaging. It pulls me into the places he&rsquo;s in and the people he&rsquo;s with
without demanding my attention but somehow making me want to read more.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a desire in people to have discriminating taste, and to be able
to describe why X is better than Y, or even just to characterize X at all
(which probably requires implicit comparison to Y, Z, Q..). Doesn&rsquo;t really
matter what it is &ndash; beer, wine, food, movies, music.</p>
<p>Reading Hemingway recount Gertrude Stein&rsquo;s reasoned dismissal and praise, I
feel that desire to have the vocabulary and depth of knowledge to make those
judgments.</p>
<p>At this point in my literary life, I can sense/feel/intuit/whatever bad
writing, as I assume most people with a bit of education (formal or otherwise)
can. Going back to favored books from my mid to late teens and finding the
prose painful is a clear enough indication that I can feel &ldquo;bad&rdquo; writing. But I
suppose real literary criticism, reading it and familiarizing myself with the
language, is how to do it.</p>
