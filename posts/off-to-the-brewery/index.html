				<p><strong>Location</strong>: La Roche-en-Ardenne -&gt; Hotton -&gt; Jemelle</p>
<p>I originally had scheduled 90 km for today. Then, upon seeing the high temp for
the day (32C), I scaled it back to 50km. I arrived in Jemelle feeling good. I
even did another 15km rountrip to get beer from Saint Monon Brewery, but now
I can feel the ride.</p>
<p>I followed the EV5 bike route the entire way, an international European route.
Well marked, well maintained, it was good riding. After the first 10km I
noticed my front tire was low. Nothing to be alarmed about, as I had
redistributed my gear to put more weight over the front tire.</p>
<p>I pumped the tire up. Again, about 500m later, I noticed the tire was getting
low again.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m pretty well versed in this dance: Take the tire off, take
the innertube out, inflate the innertube to find the hole, patch the whole.</p>
<p>I pulled over to the side of the path and leaned my bike against the hill in
someone&rsquo;s front yard. The man living in the house came out to ask if I&rsquo;m ok. I
told him I just have a flat tire and I&rsquo;ll be on my way again soon. He asked if
I needed a pump, mimicking inflating a tire. I thanked him and told him I
already had one. He went back inside.</p>
<p>I inflated the innertube but couldn&rsquo;t find the hole. I didn&rsquo;t put much effort
into it, as I had two new ones from my last (mis)adventure. I squeezed all the
air out of the old tube, folded it up, and exchanged it for the new one in my
pack. I could find the hole and patch the other tube later.</p>
<p>At this point it was a non-issue to handle a flat. I had this realization after
the fact, as I wrote this journal entry.</p>
<p>It was hot. When I was moving the breeze felt good, but I knew I was still
losing a lot of water.</p>
<p>Some time later after putting my tire back on I noticed that my front brakes
(right-side pad) were always in contact with my wheel rim slowing me down.</p>
<p>I could have tried to figure it out. I decided however to just unhook my front
brakes. This was much better. I was rolling at a normal speed and had less than
half my braking ability (the back brakes suck). What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>Bike shops are closed on Mondays in Belgium. I could get someone to look at it
tomorrow.</p>
<p>There were several steep downhill sections arriving in Jemelle that I had to
walk because I could not control my speed.</p>
<p>I arrived at the campsite dusty and thirsty. I finally understood how cowboys
in movies feel riding into town and drink the water from the ladle, or just
fall into a full water trough. It tastes really good.</p>
<p>I found the man running the campsite. The cost for one night was one euro. He
said I could pay later. I unloaded my bike, unrolled my tarp, and set my things
on the tarp. I would finish unpacking later. The campsite resembled a cross
between an RV park, a junkyard, and a hobby farm.</p>

<p>I came to Jemelle because it had the closest campsite to Ambly, a nearby
village where the Saint Monon Brewery was. Unintentionally, my original
bikepacking route went through here and by Saint Monon.</p>
<p>Having unburdened myself I remounted my bike and headed off to the grocery
store. My 3:30pm lunch consisted of a baguette, 200g of budget cheese, and a
cup of cherry tomatoes. I seem to be averaging 1.5-2 baguettes a day. Refueled,
I started the 9km ride to the brewery. The shortest way leaving from the
grocery store was mostly long, hot, exposed climbs.</p>
<p>I rode by the worst smelling farm of my life. The front yard had a swing and
kids toys strewn about. I wondered if they noticed the smell, or if everywhere
else just smelled especially good. As I rode past the final pole barn it
sounded like a pig was being either poorly slaughtered or expertly tortured.</p>
<p>The info on google maps and their website said the brewery taproom was only
open on Saturdays. Full well aware of this (it was Monday), I set out anyway.
In a past experience in Iceland, I learned that &ldquo;closed&rdquo; is usually just a
suggestion when it comes to breweries.</p>
<p>It was 4pm when I left the grocery store. Peak heat, 32C, no clouds, and
unnecessarily large hills. The streets and light made everything look french,
but the heat lent the feel of a hard baked Italian town in late summer.</p>
<p>I was in an uncharacteristically good mood. The temperature was absolutely
manageable (it would have been horrible to walk), I had eaten, I had water.
Going downhill there was a breeze.</p>
<p>I arrived in Ambly about 45min after leaving the grocery store and pedaled over
to the brewery. Unsurprisingly, it was closed. There was a large area around
back, presumably for trucks to drive into for loading beer. I walked back there
and found an employee.</p>
<p>&laquo;Excusez-moi, monsieur?&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Hm?&raquo;<br>
&laquo;Je sais que vous êtes fermés, mais serait-il possible d&rsquo;acheter des bières?&raquo;<br>
He said something positive sounding and waved me in through the back.<br></p>
<p>He showed me some of the bottling equipment and led me into the taproom, where
he talked me through a few of their beers. I grab a blanche (white), ambrée
(amber), and brune (brown).</p>

<p>Mission accomplie. The main pointed at his watch and said he had to get back to
work. I thanked the man and headed out the front of the taproom.</p>

<figcaption><small>The mirror compelled me to.</small></figcaption>
<p>I stood out front and drank the blanche. It wasn&rsquo;t strong, and tasted great
after having cycled.</p>
<p>The route back to Jemelle was longer but flatter. It wound around the hills I
had gone over on the ride there. There was a fantastic cool long downhill
through the forest. The thought occurred to me that these forests probably
hadn&rsquo;t changed in hundreds of years.</p>
<p>I sat in Jemelle on a bench across from the church and drank the amber.</p>
<p>The night was going to be warm, only 16C at the lowest. I had hopes of finally
not waking up cold in the middle of the night. On the plus side, a morning
after a cold night means any left over beer is already chilled for breakfast.</p>
