				<p><strong>Location:</strong> Bastogne -&gt; Liege -&gt; Aachen -&gt; Berlin</p>
<p>I got to the bus station to buy a ticket, only to discover that the machine
requires a certain MoBIB membership card, which you load trips on. Sounds
more or less like an oyster card in london. Because of covid, buses aren&rsquo;t
accepting cash. Frantically, with time ticking down, I attempted to register
online for one of these cards. Once you register and order a card, you can
start putting trips onto your account, and then ride. I registered and then
searched the site in vain, finding no way to order a card. With 5min to go
before the bus showed up, I died to throw myself at the driver&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>A couple in front of me has a similar tale to tell the bus driver. He waved
them on, so it didn&rsquo;t seem to be a problem. What was a problem, however, was
the bike. I spoke with a driver of the same bus line the previous night and
he told me it wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue to put my bike down below in the luggage
compartment. The driver today, however, didn&rsquo;t seem to want me to. After
begging and pleading in french he unhappily relented, stomped down from the
driver seat, and opened the storage under the bus. My bike didn&rsquo;t fit, so I
frantically removed the front wheel (which required unpacking one of my bags
to get my multitool), squeezed my bike in, and got on the bus.</p>
<p>My front wheel is held in place by a pin, I suppose equivalent to an axle,
that has a removeable spring on either end that seem to function like
washers. In my rush, I lost one of the springs. It&rsquo;s an acceptable sacrifice
for the bus ride.</p>
<p>The bus rode past the turn off to the l&rsquo;achouffe brewery, the same turn I
took on my fourth day of the trip, after having fixed a flat and despairing
that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to complete this trip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seemingly made it. Getting on the bus was the one major worry I had, the
first link in a chain of travel that could have sunk the entire return trip.
I breathed a sigh of relief, as the bus takes me directly to the train
station where I have nearly 30min to transfer, and each subsequent transfer
is incredibly easy.</p>
<p>I leaned back in my seat. This has been a most excellent adventure.</p>
<h2 id="the-enemy-of-good-is-better">The enemy of good is better</h2>
<p>After making it to the train station and onto my first train without issue, I
thought to myself, maybe I should tighten the screw holding the pin on my
front wheel in place (the one I removed so I could fit my bike in the bus).
The rod sheared right off on one of the ends as I over-tightened the screw. I
did this on the train from Liege to Welkenraedt. Fortunately the pin was
still long enough that the front tire could rest on it, and I could roll the
bike. I wheeled my bike across the platform to catch the short train over the
border into Aachen, and found a bike shop near the hauptbahnhof where I could
buy a replacement. Turns out it only cost 5EUR.</p>
<p>Being back at the Aachen HBF where it all started felt surreal. I remember so
clearly arriving here at the start of the trip, buying two sandwiches (dinner
and breakfast), and heading off onto a trip that was going to end up being
nothing how I expected. My bike was loaded all wrong. My planning all went
out the window by day two. I got to know my bike really well. Which front and
rear gear combinations work, which ones don&rsquo;t, how I should shift based on
elevation change. I developed a system where I knew where everything I had
was kept in my bags, how to distribute the weight, and the order in which I
would need my things. I&rsquo;m going to get a book and figure out how to take
apart and rebuild my bike this winter.</p>
<p>Adventure is just bad planning.</p>
