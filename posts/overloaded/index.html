				<p><strong>Location</strong>: Viersalm -&gt; La Roche-en-Ardenne</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jettison some weight, or I&rsquo;ll never make it to Cybertron!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Astrotrain couldn&rsquo;t have been more right.</p>
<p>The day started well, despite a 9C night that woke me up cold. Tonight it will
be cold again, but the nights get warmer after that. I&rsquo;ll try stuffing extra
clothing into my sleeping bag tonight to keep warm. Like a hobo.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My plan for today was to head to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8nqAhSxQXtDZ2f6G6">Saint-Hubert</a>. My exact route was
unknown, but early in the day I passed a sign for the Lupulus brewery. It was
too early to go, but I felt inspired, and searched for other breweries in the
area. I found another about an hour away on the way to Saint-Hubert.</p>
<p>Happily, it was the <a href="https://chouffe.com/en/brewery-achouffe/">Brasserie
d&rsquo;Achouffe</a>. I have a rich history
with this beer. Most of it good.</p>
<p>I head in that direction. My route follows mostly paved road, except for a
small stretch 2/3 of the way to the brewery. It&rsquo;s mostly gravel with some small
rocks. I was worried given my previous experience, but the rocks were fairly
small and I did my best to avoid them. I had also re-distributed some of the
weight to the front of my bike.</p>
<p>Following the gravel section, which was at most 300 meters, there was a steep
uphill incline to a small highway overpass. I rode over the bridge. One the
other side I felt something was wrong with my back tire. I could even hear a
hiss as the air escaped.</p>
<p>After the ordeal two days prior, then yesterday being perfect, it was crushing
to have another flat tire. I was convinced it was the weight, and that I might
not be able to even do the trip.</p>
<p>Despairing, I stopped my bike, took off my bags, and removed my back wheel. I
took off the tire and removed the innertube. I inflated the tube with my pump
(the one that doesn&rsquo;t break the innertube), and immediately found a tiny pin
hole in the rubber. I inspected the entire tube and was relieved to see it was
just the single hole. I apply a glueless patch and prepare to weight 60 seconds
for it to adhere.</p>
<p>In this moment, I felt my phone ring. The country code is +49, Germany. Not
surprising. Before answering I knew who it was. Before I left for this trip I
had a last round interview with a local company. Throughout the entire process,
despite my continual request to use email, the recruiter insisted on calling me
personally to inform me of the next steps in the process. The information
provided on these phone calls never amounted to more than a 5-6 sentence email.</p>
<p>I answered the phone. Both my hands were covered in grease. In my right hand
dangled the flaccid innertube. My left hand held the phone to my ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&quot;<br>
&ldquo;Hello, Stuart! How are you?&quot;<br>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m on a country road in Belgium fixing a flat tire, how are you?&quot;<br>
&ldquo;Uhm.. I&rsquo;m good. Is now not a good time?&quot;<br>
Me: <em>looks at innertube</em><br>
&ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told me about their job offer. She is going to send me an email containing
the same information. I think I did a fairly poor job of feigning interest. I
told her I would let her know next week, even though I had already decided to
reject the offer.</p>
<p>After the phone call, I returned to the task at hand: crippling self-doubt. I
didn&rsquo;t know if I could even do this trip, if at any moment my overloaded back
tire could go. I was essentially on perfect roads with a small gravel detour
and found myself immediately with another flat.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know if the patch would hold. I was 20min away from the brewery, and I
couldn&rsquo;t enjoy a moment of it. I could feel that my back tire had been bent. I
also knew I had to shed some weight, and the U-lock I had for my bike was going
to be the first thing to go.</p>
<p>I had a beer at the brewery. I was too pre-occupied to enjoy it. I scrapped my
plans to go to Saint-Hubert. I find the next closest city with a bike shop: La
Roche-en-Ardenne.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Pedaling there, every noise from my bike worried me. I didn&rsquo;t know if the patch
would hold or if I would pop the tire elsewhere.</p>

<figcaption><small>Another memorial at a critical moment for me. A nos liberateurs: for our liberators.</small></figcaption>
<p>Unhappy, doubt-ridden, and tired, this memorial gave me some much needed
perspective: I was riding a bicycle through a friendly country full of people
who were happy to help me, I had food and water, and my bicycle mostly worked.
I was going to be fine.</p>
<p>I arrived at the campsite and rented a space for the night. After dropping off
my gear, I headed into town to go to the bike shop before it closed. The
village is unbelievably charming.</p>
<img style="max-width: 100%; width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/roche_castle.jpg" alt="la roche-en-ardenne castle">
<figcaption><small>Within 2 minutes of entering the village I decided to stay there for at least one additional night.</small></figcaption>
<p>Pushing my bike down brick streets, my mood immediately changed for the better.
On long downhill sections I easily went 50kmph for minutes at a time. For those
minutes I forgot everything and except the wind in my face and the trees
speeding by.</p>
<p>The bike shop had a small line out the front. The two guys in front of me spoke
Flemish, and the lady working the bikeshop sounded to be a native speaker. The
area is french, so this was unexpected. It gave me hope that she spoke english.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s my turn, I asked if she spoke english or german. She said german, to
my relief.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I asked for a chain lock because the one I had was too heavy.
Then I told her I thought my rear tire was bent. She picked up the back end of
my bike, spun the tire, and laughed at how absurdly crooked it was.</p>

<p>She grabbed the rear tire and took it in the shop to straighten it out. Coming
back a few minutes later, she said it wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but I told her it looked
a lot better than it was. I gave her my huge U-lock as a gift, and assured her
it was very reliable. She laughed.</p>
<p>I grabbed my accustomed dinner from the grocery store and pedaled back to my campsite.</p>

<figcaption><small>The new chain lock proved itself capable not only securing bikes, but also baguettes.</small></figcaption>
<p>Having returned to camp, I showered, and settled down for dinner. Turns out I
forgot my soap in the shower, which a guy camping nearby returned to me. We
started to chat, and he invited me over to sit with him and his girlfriend.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re flemish. Flanders is the flat northern part of Belgium. Where we were,
in Wallonia, it was very hilly. They came to the area to go hiking. With the
leaves changing colors it was a great time to be there.</p>
<p>We talked about hiking, biking, my overloaded bike, and my new route plan (go
to breweries and campsites).</p>
<p>The guy is Corneal (like Cornelius), and the girl is Joke (yo-kuh). He&rsquo;s an
arborist who takes care of public trees and lands. She used to be a diving
instructor (&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do anything adventurous anymore,&rdquo; she complained after
describing the 70km they hiked over the last three days).</p>
<p>Corneal comes from Bruges.<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like visiting other cities when you grew up in a picture-esque medieval town?&quot;<br>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They live in Ghent and are moving in together. Despite having bought a house,
they still managed to fill it immediately with their stuff. Your belongings
grow to fill their container, be it a house, suitcase, or bike bags.</p>

<p>Note for next time: Buy a tent and get a better sleeping bag. Not only
would I have slept better, I could also would have been able to bring less
clothing to keep warm at night. This would have made the ride easier and
prevented some of my popped tires. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
