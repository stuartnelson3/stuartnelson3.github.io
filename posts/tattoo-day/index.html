			<p><strong>Location:</strong> Warsaw</p>
<p>I had a tattoo appointment today.</p>
<h2 id="on-my-tattoo-selection">On my tattoo selection</h2>
<p>I originally wanted a tattoo for my proposed trip to vietnam, which was meant
to be happening at this point in time.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> As that trip had been scuttled and
I still wanted a tattoo, I started looking through a <a href="http://streetwise.pl/2019/03/06/15-tattoo-studios-in-warsaw-you-should-know-about/">best tattoo
shop</a>
list for warsaw. I looked through dozens of artists' instagram pages.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted. I have a short list of tattoo ideas I&rsquo;ve been
growing the last few years, but I feel no pressure to get them.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Looking at the instagram pages, I was blown away by the quality of the
tattoos these artists were putting out. Warsaw is home to some supremely
talented people. For comparison, I had done a similar search for artists in
salzburg and was underwhelmed. Poland does it better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had on my tattoo list some sort of odin the wanderer / gandalf character
for a while. All the tattoo examples I had seen were always too detailed or
too big for my personal taste. As I was scrolling through another instagram
profile (I had easily gone through over a dozen at this point. I can usually
dismiss an artist as &lsquo;not my style&rsquo; immediately, but still enjoy looking at
their work), I came across a style that was mostly borderless shading. Very
cool. I immediately <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hO1iVHXzW/">loved the
style</a>, and as I scrolled further,
I encountered <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BqnGXlUHeJK/">a fantastic gandalf</a>
that fit my taste perfectly: black and gray, simple but with great shading,
and unquestionably gandalf while still maintaining a wonderful economy of
lines. I had already made up my mind to contact the artist, but continued
scrolling and found a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BW0KMTAluBo/">delightful
character</a> that had the same key
iconography as gandalf &ndash; pointed cap, cloak, traveling pack. The artist had
done <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BelCVQPH2pD/">several</a>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCQ60EVHDmf/">cool</a>
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BenuNZJnG0R/">variations</a>. I decided I wanted
one without even knowing who this little wanderer was.</p>
<p>I shared the image with friends and a swedish one exclaimed &ldquo;Snusmumriken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turns out he&rsquo;s a swedish/finnish children&rsquo;s book character, a wandering nomad
with only the possessions on his back. It was perfect. I read one of the
books and saw no reason not to get him. His name in english is Snufkin.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-tattoo">Getting the tattoo</h2>
<p>Tattoo time. I was excited, to say the least. I walked into the shop, had my
temperature taken (covid), filled out the waiver forms, and sat down with the
artist to go over the sketch she had drawn.</p>
<p>When we spoke on instagram I initially wasn&rsquo;t really sure what I wanted.
Having had a week to mull it over I had changed my mind a bit. Working with
Ola, the artist, was so cool. She had the sketch on her iPad. As we spoke she
highlighted layers on the sketch, deleted parts, changed others &ndash; it was all
so fluid. It was very cool to see her work and be a part of the process as it
happened.</p>

<figcaption><small>Live sketching. Having her make suggestions, rotate the sketch, and show changes, was really cool.</small></figcaption>
</div>
<p>We finished the design, she printed out four sizes, and I looked at how they
sat on my thigh. Originally when we spoke I gave her the option of the side
of my ribs, or my thigh, and she chose thigh. Something about the placement
wasn&rsquo;t doing it for me, though. I took one of the print-outs and placed it on
the inside of my calf. It fit great, sitting right on the muscle and not
spilling over on to my shin bone. I also really liked the idea that as my
calf flexed while I walked, he would be walking too. Ola flipped the image
and printed it out (reflection over the y-axis), and we headed in to the
studio.</p>
<p>Ola was shy about speaking english at first. When I told her I was american
she was mortified that she would have to talk with a native speaker in her
imperfect english. I was totally cool about it, and even enjoyed how we had
mime words to each other, and she relaxed pretty quick when she realized I
was having fun.</p>
<p>We seemed to develop an easy back and forth conversation immediately. At the
start she was laughing so much I was wondering how my tattoo was going to
turn out.</p>
<p>Her tattoo machine was wireless. I had never seen that before and told her
how cool it was. She asked me if I had ever used one. I said no. She asked if
I wanted to try. I said of course.</p>
<p>She gave me gloves and showed me how to hold my skin taut for tattooing. I
held the tattoo machine and, not knowing what to draw, opted for a little
line above the stencil of snufkin on my calf. She told me I needed to put the
needle deeper into my skin. So I did another line. Well, I had come this far,
so I did two more. It didn&rsquo;t hurt. Afterwards I handed the tattoo machine
back and she resumed tattooing, I watched more closely how she did it (funny
that I had never really paid attention after already having five tattoos),
like how she stabilized her hand by holding her pinky out on my leg. I made a
mental note to do that the next time I tattoo myself, and not just have my
arm free in the air.</p>

<figcaption><small>I saw no reason not to do this. It actually didn't hurt.</small></figcaption>
</div>
<p>She asked me how old I was. I said 32. I asked her how old she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t ask that! You can guess. But be nice.&quot;<br>
<em>Ola waves tattoo machine threateningly</em><br>
&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t like your guess, I draw sad little dick next to Snufkin.&quot;<br>
&ldquo;Erm, 27?&quot;<br></p>
<p>She did not draw a sad little dick next to Snufkin.</p>
<p>After relating this story to a friend, he asked &ldquo;did you tell her you already
had one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked about our families, their expectations, our lives (she bought a
camper van and is planning on just living out of it and driving it around
europe), books, movies. She got really shy again when a coworker came into
the room where we were. She was embarrassed about her english when she didn&rsquo;t
need to be.</p>
<p>She had my try to repeat some polish phrases, including polish tongue
twisters. She and her coworker were laughing out loud at how bad I was. She
even started crying she was laughing so hard. She said she would make a
recording of me and listen in the mornings when she got up.</p>
<p>This was easily the best experience getting tattoo&rsquo;d that I&rsquo;ve had. I think
she had an awesome time too. She gave me a big hug when I left, and told me
to message her on Sunday and she&rsquo;d show me around.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone not having a great time in Poland. The people, the
food, the history, the culture. It&rsquo;s a really great place. Ola told me during
my tattoo that she had a different appointment for that day, but because the
person lives in Warsaw, she had bumped it to two weeks later so I could get
my tattoo.</p>
<p>As I was leaving I checked my phone. A friend had sent me several
recommendations for places to eat. At this point pizza sounded really good. I
decided to go to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Kha2S9WyCcgaYSc69">nonna pizzeria</a>,
which was great.</p>
<p>Feeling like it&rsquo;d be good to get out, I found a cocktail bar that looked
cool. It was steampunk-themed. The cocktails were excellent.</p>

<p>After a couple exceedingly good drinks, I headed back to my airbnb.</p>

<p>I had even found and contacted an artist on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/black.fishhh/">instagram</a>. His stuff looks
awesome, and I&rsquo;m still hoping to get something from him. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The oldest on the list is actually a line from the aeneid, which I&rsquo;ve
been contemplating since 2011: &lsquo;stat sua cuique dies&rsquo;. As much as I think it
would be cool, I imagine it&rsquo;d drive me crazy having to explain the meaning to
every single person who saw it. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
