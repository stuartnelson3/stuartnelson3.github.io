				<p><strong>Location</strong>: Berlin -&gt; Aachen -&gt; Lac Gileppe</p>
<p>Long travel day. After a tearful goodbye with my hetero life partner Lukas, we
were off to the races. Berlin HBF to be exact.</p>
<p>The train from HBF to Bad Oeynhausen (yeah, seriously) was easy. From there,
transfer to a regional train to Düsseldorf HBF. This is where it got
interesting.</p>
<p>Halfway through the three or so hour ride, there was a train blocking the track
(between Oelde and Neubeckum). We got off a stop before Oelde, in
Rheda-Wiedenbrück, for the replacement bus that would take us two stops further
down the line, where we could catch the train and continue our journey.</p>
<p>When I get to the bus I&rsquo;m told that my bike can&rsquo;t go on the bus. Fuck. So I had
to ride 22km to the station where I can pick up my train again. The next train
leaves in about an hour, and it&rsquo;s probably going to take me about an hour to
get there.</p>
<p>I arrived just in time to see the train pulling away. Fuck. Fortunately the
train leaves every hour, so I only have sixty minutes to kill. This definitely
isn&rsquo;t a world-ending delay, but between this pushing back my arrival time at my
first campsite (probably in the dark), and the trip having just started, I
wasn&rsquo;t super thrilled.</p>
<p>The remainder of the trip, to Düsseldorf, and then from there to Aachen, was
uneventful.</p>
<p>From here it was time for the bike trip to begin. I was riding to Lac Gileppe
(around <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ELDRbJUvHPzLmMj49">here-ish</a>), 30km away. It was
early evening and I should be able to reach my campsite before dark.</p>
<p>Aachen is not Berlin. It has massive hills, some I can&rsquo;t even bike up, and I
had about 2.5 hours until dark. I needed to make it through the city and get on
my way.</p>
<p>Belgium, particularly Wallonia, is not Berlin. The ride at first was smooth
highway. Quickly it turned into forest roads with some truly gnarly elevation
gain. Again, I ended up pushing my bike.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I reached the north western corner of the lake and followed a walking path
down. After crossing a bridge with a huge stone lion (felt like an
<a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Argonath">Argonath</a> from Lord of the Rings), I
continued following a route around the lake hunting for a spot to camp.</p>
<img style="max-width: 100%; width: auto; height: auto;" src="/images/lion.jpg" alt="lion">
<figcaption><small>This lion looking out over the resevoir reminded me of the <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Argonath">Argonath</a> from Lord of the Rings.</small></figcaption>
<p>After passing several places that all looked similar, I settle on one between
the path and the lake. It slopes downhill, which won&rsquo;t be a problem for my
hammock.</p>
<p>I forgot how jumpy I am sleeping outside. My food was hung in a tree 20m from
me, I was off the ground in a hammock, but every noise or rustle in the bushes
made me start. I was pretty sure I heard somethings snuffling around in the
underbrush. I growled at it.</p>
<p>The hammock does not insulate. I had all my layers on and still I was cold.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
It was about 8C. I inflated Fabian&rsquo;s Thermarest and put it under me in the
hammock. Instantly I felt warmer and was able to fall asleep.</p>

<p>At this point, I was still getting to know my bike. The gears, in
particular, are a bit finicky. Some combinations between the front chain
rings and the rear cogset work wonderfully. Some do not work at all &ndash; as in,
the chain never settles in and pedaling results in awkwardly skipping over
teeth or something.  Because shifting to the lowest gear in the front and a
middle gear in the back had this issue, I (incorrectly) assumed that shifting
the back gears down further would suffer from the same problem.</p>
<p>Whether this is an issue with my equipment, or its calibration, I do not know. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>While the hammock was never going to keep me warm, I probably would have
been fine if I had not been in my bivouac sack, or was <a href="https://stuartnelson3.github.io/posts/rest-day/#on-bivy-sacks">using it
correctly</a>. I
learned in the following days what I should have done. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
