				<p><strong>Location:</strong> Reims -&gt; Charleville-Mézière -&gt; Fumay -&gt; Ochamp</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m returning to camping today. And biking. I&rsquo;ve literally only been away
from it for two days, but the whole idea already seems weird. And I had been
camping for two weeks.</p>
<p>Rain and storms are coming in the rest of the week, starting in a day or two.
At great financial cost (comparatively .. 40EUR/night vs. camping for
~5EUR/night) I took a room in Bastogne for the remainder of the trip. There&rsquo;s
a lot of history there. Also, with the rain coming and no real destination
beyond that, having a warm room and being able to liesurely visit the town
for a few days sounds nice. Frank arrives friday, and then we head to the
netherlands (and the bismut concert) on saturday.</p>
<p>I made a bit of a logistics error. I took the train to fumay and crossed
massive hills to get to ochamp. I should have gone to sedan, saved myself
about 20km of cycling, and probably a good deal of elevation gain.</p>

</div>
<p>I ended up sleeping in the woods. As the trip started, so the trip ends. The
bivouac site is 2km away from where I am, but the path was basically
bushwhacking the entire way. After about 70km of cycling with lots of
elevation change, running out of water, and decent heat, I was done. Tomorrow
is an extremely easy cycle on a paved ravel route, and I felt like I was
ready to rest.</p>

</div>
<p>I called Bert to tell him I wouldn&rsquo;t make it to see him. He appreciated me calling to let him know. He seems nice.</p>
<p>Reading about hemingway&rsquo;s trip with f. scott fitzgerald in &ldquo;a moveable feast&rdquo;
makes me realize all my challenges, troubles, and frustrations are just a
part of a worthwhile adventure.</p>
