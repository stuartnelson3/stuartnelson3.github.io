			<p>It seems like all the things I want are the primary causes of stress in my
life.</p>
<p>If I just didn&rsquo;t try for these things, I&rsquo;d have a much simpler and less
stressful life. It&rsquo;s definitely taking me from what I would rather be doing,
but I think the &ldquo;things&rdquo; I&rsquo;d rather be doing in Berlin are a local maximum
for what I could be doing with my time, vs. what I&rsquo;m hoping will be a higher
level of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
For this post, I&rsquo;m experimenting with embedding bandcamp links. So here
you go, have a listen. If you like music, you should buy it from <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">bandcamp</a>.</p>
<p>Stay loose, stay wild, stay free.</p>

<h1 id="dual-citizenship">Dual Citizenship</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently attempting to get dual citizenship (I&rsquo;m American, and going for
German citizenship). If I were to just follow the desires of Germany and
relinquish my American citizenship in favor of German citizenship, this would
be super easy. Because I want to have both, I need to also prove that it&rsquo;s in
Germany&rsquo;s interest to have me as a citizen, but that it&rsquo;s also greatly in my
interest to remain American (for work or whatever other reasons).</p>
<p>In addition to that, I have to take a language test (B2, looks like it&rsquo;ll be
easy), and the citizenship test (33 questions multiple choice, 17/33 is a
pass). No part of this seems difficult, but having these as tests of my
abilities with the possibility of failure definitely create a level of stress
that I otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Now, for this level of stress (short term, honestly quite minimal), the
positive outcome would be worth so much. To be a citizen of the EU and
America would guarantee me the ability to live across a massive area of the
world, and if I were to have children (if), they would also be guaranteed
these citizenships, in additional to any others they may get based on my
partner/location at that time. If I get dual citizenship I can definitely see
myself either picking up stakes and heading elsewhere in the EU, or at least
seriously considering investing in a second place while maintaining my fairly
cheap and well situated apartment in Berlin.</p>
<h1 id="speculative-part-time-work">Speculative Part-time Work</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m working full time at <a href="https://elastic.co">elastic.co</a> but also 6 hours a week or
so for a local brewery. It&rsquo;s really not many hours at the end of the week,
but it&rsquo;s definitely an effort on a Saturday or Sunday to say &ldquo;Ok, now I have
to work for a few hours&rdquo; when I really don&rsquo;t feel like it. I&rsquo;m not being
paid, but I suppose I&rsquo;m viewing it as any other investment. Most likely
nothing will come of it, but if for some reason it transitions into something
larger, having that early-stage foot in the door would be awesome.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Clearly it makes sense to do these things now. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not
looking forward to them being done, though. Here&rsquo;s to me writing in a few
months about how I have my german citizenship..</p>
