		<p>I&rsquo;m going to try something new.</p>
<p>I tend to have fairly vivid dreams. They also can be pretty crazy. So I&rsquo;m going
to attempt to write them down and maybe throw out a little analysis. Some of
them are pretty clear; some are not.</p>
<p>My goal is two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember some of these dreams and what my subconscious was going through at
the time</li>
<li>Be able to come back to perhaps come up with a better interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-dream">The Dream</h1>
<p>The first dream in this series is pretty straight forward, as far as I can tell.
I was in my family&rsquo;s cabin up in northern Minnesota with a good friend, and we
were hanging out watching tv or something.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It was the middle of the day and
sunny outside, but the windows were mostly covered with cobwebs and dust. The
light still managed to show through into the cabin. Outside, after I brushed
away some of the dust and cobwebs, I could see on either side of the cabin a
young family playing in the sun. Something like a standard
father/mother/children setup.</p>

		<p>It seems like all the things I want are the primary causes of stress in my
life.</p>
<p>If I just didn&rsquo;t try for these things, I&rsquo;d have a much simpler and less
stressful life. It&rsquo;s definitely taking me from what I would rather be doing,
but I think the &ldquo;things&rdquo; I&rsquo;d rather be doing in Berlin are a local maximum
for what I could be doing with my time, vs. what I&rsquo;m hoping will be a higher
level of happiness.</p>

<p>As I finished reading the above post, I reached the final section that was
listing the architects who had been mentioned, and where they hailed from. At
that moment, when I thought about life as a professor at a university (not
that any of the people mentioned are professors, it&rsquo;s just the idea as it
occurred to me), I was thinking about how they feel about their salary.</p>

<p>I had two things on my mind waking up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coffee with Weronika</li>
<li>Tattoo with Aleksandra (who is actually Ola)</li>
</ol>
<p>I matched with Weronika on bumble the preceding morning. I mentioned
immediately that I was getting a tattoo the next day, she asked what shop,
and was super excited when I said Caffeine Tattoo. She had a half sleeve done
there by the shop owner (not Ola).</p>
<p>We hit it off immediately and texted for a couple hours, and then scheduled
coffee before my tattoo. She had to work, but that night we ended up texting
for another few hours, and seemed to be having a good time. So, naturally, I
was looking forward to meeting her.</p>

large rectangular pastry filled with cheese and spinach for breakfast. They
had about 8 different kinds, and I want to try tme all.</p>

<p>I took a long walk to the reconstructed old town, and walked from its
southernmost end up to the northernmost, then headed back south on a path
along the river. The original old town was razed by the nazis as punishment
for the warsaw uprising. The reconstruction is charming and great to walk
through. Within the old town, only polish citizens are allowed to own
property (as I was told). There are enough restaurants to keep someone busy
for weeks. It&rsquo;s definitely the highest density tourist area. Other than
polish, the language I heard most often was german (guided tours).</p>

<p>The train from Berlin to Warsaw was less than eventful. The train was direct,
I had some music, and they were handing out free water. Couldn&rsquo;t be easier.</p>
<p>After a simple airbnb check-in, I scoped out a route to the tourist area full
of restaurants I remembered from my previous trip, and headed out to find
some dinner.</p>
<p>Poland has this concept called a &ldquo;milk bar&rdquo;. Originally serving dairy
products, they now (and for a long time) serve all sorts of traditional
polish foods &ndash; cabbage, potatoes, breaded fried pork cutlets, pierogi &ndash; at
a crazy low, government-subsidized, cost.</p>

<p>I got to the bus station to buy a ticket, only to discover that the machine
requires a certain MoBIB membership card, which you load trips on. Sounds
more or less like an oyster card in london. Because of covid, buses aren&rsquo;t
accepting cash. Frantically, with time ticking down, I attempted to register
online for one of these cards. Once you register and order a card, you can
start putting trips onto your account, and then ride. I registered and then
searched the site in vain, finding no way to order a card. With 5min to go
before the bus showed up, I died to throw myself at the driver&rsquo;s mercy.</p>

<p>I woke up feeling like something was off.</p>
<p>Not so much wanderlust as much as fernweh, despite being away from &ldquo;home&rdquo;.
When I left the house last night for dinner, my hostess was watching tv on
the couch. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that I&rsquo;m simply in a home that&rsquo;s bothering me.
Which is a weird thing to contemplate.</p>
<p>I walked to the bastogne war museum. I thought it was about the battle of the
bulge, but it covered the run up to WW2, starting with the end of WW1, and
all the way through to the war&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>Not much to say about today. I woke up around 8am. My destination was only 2
hours away, and the check-in time was 5pm.</p>
<p>I hung out at my &ldquo;campsite&rdquo; reading and watching &ldquo;no reservations&rdquo; until noon
or so. I had three pints left over from the previous day, and I didn&rsquo;t want
to bike with that with me. So there was some morning drinking.</p>
<p>The ride followed a &ldquo;pre&rdquo; ravel route. It was well defined, followed an old
train line, and went straight to Bastogne. The designation &ldquo;pre&rdquo; meant that
it was gravel or packed earth, unlike an official route which would have been
paved. It was kind of boring, to be honest. There was no turning for 35km.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m returning to camping today. And biking. I&rsquo;ve literally only been away
from it for two days, but the whole idea already seems weird. And I had been
camping for two weeks.</p>
<p>Rain and storms are coming in the rest of the week, starting in a day or two.
At great financial cost (comparatively .. 40EUR/night vs. camping for
~5EUR/night) I took a room in Bastogne for the remainder of the trip. There&rsquo;s
a lot of history there. Also, with the rain coming and no real destination
beyond that, having a warm room and being able to liesurely visit the town
for a few days sounds nice. Frank arrives friday, and then we head to the
netherlands (and the bismut concert) on saturday.</p>

<p>I woke up and had coffee in the airbnb. That was a delightful way to start the
day. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting going back to camping, albeit for only one
night.</p>
<p>I started considering my next residence after this bike trip. I was planning
on Warsaw / Krakow, but actually a month rental in Paris is under 1000EUR,
and pretty centrally located. It&rsquo;s definitely something to consider, but the
cost of everything will be a lot more &ndash; probably 2-3x more than Poland. Just
the airbnb rental in warsaw is half of the cost of one in Paris, not even
considering food and beer.</p>

pronouncing it, does not exist.</p>
<p>I had a very slow start to the day. My bus to Reims left at 15:27, and there
wasn&rsquo;t much going on in CM on a saturday morning.</p>
<p>The bus to Reims was uneventful. I listened to, for the umpteenth time, Colour

little pillboxes facing north upriver. I&rsquo;m guessing it was to harass an attempt
at nazi incursion into france.</p>

snoozed until 8:30am. The bike repair shop (remember I had unhooked my front
brakes?) didn&rsquo;t open until 9:30am.</p>
<p>I got up and packed. My breakfast was 3 belgian waffles and the remaining brown
beer from Saint Monon. They went together really well. I tried to find the guy
running the junkyard/campsite, but he was nowhere to be found. I&rsquo;m now probably
wanted in the area for not paying the one euro for the campsite.</p>

I can feel the ride.</p>
<p>I followed the EV5 bike route the entire way, an international European route.
Well marked, well maintained, it was good riding. After the first 10km I
noticed my front tire was low. Nothing to be alarmed about, as I had
redistributed my gear to put more weight over the front tire.</p>

<p>Either their algorithm for calculting difficulty is off
(probable) or I&rsquo;ve gotten in a lot better shape (less likely). The 10-ish km I
hiked were not challenging; I hardly broke a sweat. It was all in the
forest, which was nice, but absent more than the occasional hilly view, not
much was going on. I didn&rsquo;t have to shower after the hike.</p>

short for route à vélo longue. I had been following some of these routes
without knowing it, and having an official map sounded like a good idea.</p>
<p>La Roche-en-Ardenne is such a cute town. I paid for two more nights at the
campsite, planning to rest in town today and hike in the area tomorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jettison some weight, or I&rsquo;ll never make it to Cybertron!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Astrotrain couldn&rsquo;t have been more right.</p>
<p>The day started well, despite a 9C night that woke me up cold. Tonight it will
be cold again, but the nights get warmer after that. I&rsquo;ll try stuffing extra
clothing into my sleeping bag tonight to keep warm. Like a hobo.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>My plan for today was to head to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8nqAhSxQXtDZ2f6G6">Saint-Hubert</a>. My exact route was
unknown, but early in the day I passed a sign for the Lupulus brewery. It was
too early to go, but I felt inspired, and searched for other breweries in the
area. I found another about an hour away on the way to Saint-Hubert.</p>

<p>It rained several times in the night. Despite my inability as an outdoorsman,
my tarp kept me dry. Except for waking up cold between 5am and 7am (cf. previous
comment on bivouac sacks), I slept well.</p>
<p>I broke camp around 9:30am. I had only drunk two of the three beers from the
previous night, so I had a Leffe with breakfast. Breakfast was a bit of peanut
butter with some dried cranberries.</p>

<p>I broke camp early and ate my leftover sandwich that I bought in Aachen HBF. It
was bread and camembert, and would become my diet for the next three weeks
(although I did not know this at the time).</p>
<p>The biking was brutal uphill. I had been &ldquo;training&rdquo; in the previous months, but
15 sets of 3min hill runs do not come close to preparing you for a 2.5 hour
uphill grind. Looking back, maybe this would have been fine if I had known
better how to shift my gears. It almost certainly would have been better if I
hadn&rsquo;t overpacked. These were lessons that I learned, but looking back, I was
always going to make this first mistake. Having gone backpacking several times
I tried to pack light but felt overconfident in how much my bike could hold.</p>

<p>Long travel day. After a tearful goodbye with my hetero life partner Lukas, we
were off to the races. Berlin HBF to be exact.</p>
<p>The train from HBF to Bad Oeynhausen (yeah, seriously) was easy. From there,
transfer to a regional train to Düsseldorf HBF. This is where it got
interesting.</p>
<p>Halfway through the three or so hour ride, there was a train blocking the track
(between Oelde and Neubeckum). We got off a stop before Oelde, in
Rheda-Wiedenbrück, for the replacement bus that would take us two stops further
down the line, where we could catch the train and continue our journey.</p>

		<p><strong>Location:</strong> Berlin</p>
<p>Officially I&rsquo;ve been unemployed for one week. Because I was still in my
apartment, still working (small project generating sales reports for bräugier),
still leading my normal life, it didn&rsquo;t really feel like anything had changed.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I handed over my keys to my apartment, put my bags on my bike, and became homeless.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m staying two nights with Lukas, but officially, I have no place of my own)</p>
