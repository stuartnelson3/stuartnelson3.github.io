				<p><strong>Location:</strong> Revin -&gt; Charleville-Mézière</p>
<p>The ride today was a non-event. It was 44km of, again, pristine paved voie
verte. I reached my destination very quickly. Along the way I passed several
little pillboxes facing north upriver. I&rsquo;m guessing it was to harass an attempt
at nazi incursion into france.</p>

<p>By noon I was in Charleville-Mézière. I had a whole day to be in the city. It
was by far the largest place I had been in for almost two weeks.</p>
<p>After getting a spot at a campsite, the first order of business was to
straighten out taking the train tomorrow down to Reims, where I was going to
hang out with Etienne for the weekend. He had planned a weekend of
sophistication for us: champagne tasting, beer tasting, general drinking. He
knew better than to take a flannel-clad, cargo pants wearing american
elsewhere.</p>
<p>I spoke with the lady at the trainstation and got everything straightened out
surprisingly easily. The train was actually a bus scheduled for 15:30 tomorrow.</p>
<p>Having taken care of my one task for the day, I headed to the grocery store to
get lunch and beer. Since I was homeless, three beers seemed appropriate.</p>
<p>I posted up at Winston Churchill Place, a little square with a memorial to
fallen soldiers of the city. I had expected to have the square to myself, being
that it was early afternoon on a friday.</p>
<p>A group of three girls in their seemingly early 20s walked by. I didn&rsquo;t think
anything of it. Then another group of girls about the same age walked by. Then
another. At this point I thought to myself, something is going on. Looking to
the right I saw a mass of kids hanging out and talking. At this point I
realized that they probably aren&rsquo;t in their early 20s, but they&rsquo;re
highschoolers in their late teens, and they&rsquo;re congregating for some unknown
reason. I was sitting on a bench, dirty, scruffy, with my bags and bike,
drinking beer, where the highschoolers come to hang out.</p>

<p>I fully appreciated how this probably looked. But I wasn&rsquo;t going to leave until
I finished my third beer. I was there first, after all. And the bar I had
planned on going to later didn&rsquo;t start happy hour until 16:00 (pints of le
chouffe were 5 euros).</p>
<p>After a brief walk to kill time until the bar opened (le rétro), I sat at the
bar and had some more beer. The music was good, the weather was nice, and the
beer was cheap. Unfortunately, a few 8% le chouffes later, I was holding on to
my chair to keep from falling out.</p>
<p>I asked the bartender if I could pay. He looked at me and said &ldquo;that&rsquo;s probably
a good idea.&rdquo; I retired to my campsite for dinner.</p>
