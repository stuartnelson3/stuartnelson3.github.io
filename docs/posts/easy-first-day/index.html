				<p><strong>Location</strong>: Mestia</p>
<p>The first day started with a short avalanche rescue refresher: using beacons,
digging, that sort of thing. After we finished that, we had a short tour (~900
vertical meters), rode ~350m down, then climbed back up, and skied out.</p>

<p>The ski out took us back through the village we had initially walked through.
It was fun, but also full of cow shit. And, surprise, also the cows. The cows
decided to congregate around our vehicles, which made it difficult to take our
skis off and walk the final bit back. Second most cow-shit I&rsquo;ve ever had to
wash off my ski boots after a tour.</p>

<p>I had dinner with Dagmara (poland) and Louis (france), a married couple, and
Jakob (usa). We had some good food, but the electricity in the restaurant would
cycle off every 20min or so. The restaurant had 4 tables, and felt like I was
eating in a small deli somewhere in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Post-journal edit:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in touch with Louis and Dagmara off and on, as they live in ZÃ¼rich
and have a place in Chamonix. I haven&rsquo;t talked with Jakob since the trip. I
imagine I&rsquo;ll see them all again on a trip with Pawel.</p>
