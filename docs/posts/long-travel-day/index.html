				<p><strong>Location</strong>: Innsbruck -&gt; Munich -&gt; Tbilisi -&gt; Mestia</p>
<p>Train from Innsbruck to Munich, flight from Munich to Tbilisi, taxi to the hostel.</p>
<p>It was chaos leaving the airport. Everyone tries to get you into their taxi. I
was told to book with bolt, and uber-esque app.</p>
<p>The drivers ask you where you are going, and when you say you are going to book
with bolt, they say &ldquo;yes, yes I have bolt!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I persisted, saying, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m booking with the app. If you get my fare, then
I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently the taxi drivers charge 2-3x what bolt does. After I made clear I
was going to use the Bolt app, the swarm of taxi drivers moved on to another
target.</p>
<p>I arrived at the hostel around 06.00 or 06.30, the Hotel Fabrika. It&rsquo;s a big
old warehouse (hence the name Fabrika). The front door is open, but no one is
at the desk.</p>

</div>
<p>I wander through the large and interestingly decorated main room, past sofas
and tables and chairs, looking for a bathroom. I find it, and it&rsquo;s locked. This
is unfortunate.</p>
<p>Thankfully, someone appears at the front desk. I know I have a room in the
hotel, so I talk with the lady to try to get my key. She can&rsquo;t figure what room
I&rsquo;m in, so I ask her to let me into the bathroom in the &ldquo;lobby&rdquo; (it feels more
like some sort of hip cafe, with old books and news papers in the large open
bookshelves, etc).</p>
<p>I end up sleeping on a couch in the lobby for two hours until everyone comes
down to breakfast. It was not a long night (I can&rsquo;t sleep on planes), but
that&rsquo;s what I got. I wake up as a group enters the lobby with all their gear
and are bustling around. I eventually introduce myself to the people seemingly
in charge, get introduced to the rest of the group, eat breakfast, and then
load our stuff into the vans outside.</p>

<p>We had originally booked a plane ride to get to Mestia, which would have taken
a couple hours. The plane companies canceled last minute (we expect because
they received better offers from the Freeride World Tour, which was setting up
in Mestia for a competition the following week), and had to scramble to
organize one massive van to take us all.</p>
<p>The trip takes 8 hours. Within 30min we stopped to pick up another passenger
who&rsquo;s not associated with our group. Shortly after we stop on the highway so
the driver can buy wine in a plastic RC cola bottle. Our next stop was at
4:30pm, for lunch. It was a very long ride. We sort of talked, but I was
drifting in and out.</p>

</div>
<p>We arrive at the hotel in Mestia. We check in, drop our stuff, and I go our for
food and beer alone. I asked if anyone wanted to get food in the town, but no
one felt like going out. This would be a recurring theme for the trip.</p>
