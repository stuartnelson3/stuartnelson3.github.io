				<p><strong>Location:</strong> La Roche-en-Ardenne</p>
<p>After yesterday&rsquo;s complete rest day, I found a &ldquo;challenging&rdquo; hike in the area
using <a href="https://www.komoot.com/discover">komoot</a>.</p>
<p>Either their algorithm for calculting difficulty is off
(probable) or I&rsquo;ve gotten in a lot better shape (less likely). The 10-ish km I
hiked were not challenging; I hardly broke a sweat. It was all in the
forest, which was nice, but absent more than the occasional hilly view, not
much was going on. I didn&rsquo;t have to shower after the hike.</p>

<p>I biked into town and posted at a cafe to drink a few beers and read Hemingway
(&ldquo;Men without women&rdquo;). A group of students sat a few tables away from me
speaking english. A few americans, one english person, and a smattering of
other accents. I didn&rsquo;t say anything to them.</p>
<p>I grabbed a late-day baguette from the bakery and some jambon d&rsquo;Ardenne and
tartine d&rsquo;Ardenne from the butcher across the street. They were fantastic. The
tartine was very similar to leberwurst. The ham was easily the better of the
two.</p>

<p>I had a relaxed evening. I spoke with my parents and watched a couple old
episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain%3A_No_Reservations">No
Reservations</a>.</p>
<p>It was good to talk with my folks. Quality human contact is at a minimum on
this trip. Bars are not open thanks to covid-19. I also don&rsquo;t really speak
french.</p>
<h2 id="anthony-bourdain">Anthony Bourdain</h2>
<p>I could write a lot about him. I&rsquo;ll try to keep this manageable.</p>
<p>I loved him in No Reservations. When I first watched them, I was a lot younger
(not the years, the mileage, but for those wondering, it was probably 10-15
years ago).</p>
<p>Watching him now as a slightly more mature human I find him and his show
captivating.</p>
<p>In the Vienna episode he re-shoots several famous scenes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Man">&ldquo;The Third
Man&rdquo;</a>. He quotes the most famous
line from Orson Welles while riding the same ferris wheel as in the movie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victims? Don&rsquo;t be melodramatic. Look down there. Tell me. Would you really
feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music for the episode, if not taken from the soundtrack, is in the exact
same style.</p>
<p>The opening of the Provence episode shows him running his hand through a field
of wheat, exactly like Maximus in Gladiator.</p>
<p>His love for books, film, music, food, and culture screams through each
episode. And it&rsquo;s not some shallow reference &ndash; he knows and loves this stuff.
In his modern way, a late discovered and even more tragically early lost
renaissance man. An autodidact in writing, directing, and editing.</p>
<p>Of the famous people who have died during my lifetime, his death is the only
one that continues to register as sad multiple years later.</p>
