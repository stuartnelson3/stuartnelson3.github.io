				<p><strong>Location</strong>: Lac Gileppe -&gt; Sourbrodt</p>
<p>I broke camp early and ate my leftover sandwich that I bought in Aachen HBF. It
was bread and camembert, and would become my diet for the next three weeks
(although I did not know this at the time).</p>
<p>The biking was brutal uphill. I had been &ldquo;training&rdquo; in the previous months, but
15 sets of 3min hill runs do not come close to preparing you for a 2.5 hour
uphill grind. Looking back, maybe this would have been fine if I had known
better how to shift my gears. It almost certainly would have been better if I
hadn&rsquo;t overpacked. These were lessons that I learned, but looking back, I was
always going to make this first mistake. Having gone backpacking several times
I tried to pack light but felt overconfident in how much my bike could hold.</p>
<p>The area I was in is dotted with small villages. There is no shortage of places
to get food, but a lot of restaurants are closed on Monday, or Tuesday, or
both. In addition to that, they have a break in the middle of the day during
down times (2pm-6pm) when they aren&rsquo;t open.</p>
<p>I had picked a restaurant for lunch only to discover that it was not open on
this day. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised, but still disappointed. I cycled further on to a
place that was finally open and ordered a beer. I couldn&rsquo;t decide between
spaghetti bolognese and and cheese croquettes (small bits of cheese, breaded
and fried). Deciding on the croquettes, allegedly more of the region, I knew I
made the wrong choice when I saw the size of the bolognese. Should have gone
with that.</p>
<p>Post-meal the path took a turn for the downhill. It felt really good, I was
making a lot of kilometers, so when the path became extremely rocky and steep,
I tried my luck on the bike. Following a lot of bouncing, I came out seemingly
ok. A short flat ride later and I was on to the next rocky descent for a ride
along the river.</p>
<p>I passed another <a href="https://g.page/moulin-du-bayehon?share">closed restaurant</a>
and rode on further south. This time the rocks got the better of me. Reaching
the flat part after about a kilometer of riding down, I realized my back tire
was flat. It was damp by the river and the trail was not quite mud, and my
shirt clung to my back. I had hoped to make it the entire trip without getting
a flat.</p>
<p>I removed my bags from my bike, removed the tire, and then took off the
innertube.  I first tried patching the tire. After putting on a glueless patch
over the small tear in the innertube, I found two more. I patched them. And
then I found even more rips and decided to use a fresh innertube.</p>
<p>The pump I had with me I purchased for cheap in Berlin. It was not a good pump.
After pumping up my new innertube, removing the pump also unscrewed the end of
the pin, deflating the tire. I tried twice more to unsuccessfully inflate and
remove my pump from the tire.</p>
<p>Now, sitting on the side of the damp path, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do. I wasn&rsquo;t
near anywhere helpful and I couldn&rsquo;t inflate my rear tire.</p>
<p>Four belgians on mountain bikes rode by, and I flagged them down for help. Amid
handwaving and terrible french, I was able to explain to them what happened.
They didn&rsquo;t have innertubes that fit my bike, but they tried to inflate my
innertube. My cheap pump had damaged the innertube so even they could not
inflate my innertube.</p>
<p>They told me a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XriVyoQBTw1h5j7o9">bike shop</a> to go to, and
to walk back up the path to the closed restaurant and call for a taxi.</p>
<p>This sounds good in theory, but I knew my french would not be able to handle
that. As I&rsquo;m pushing my bike uphill and damaging my rear tire rim, I came
across a car with a Netherlands license plate. I flag them down and speak with
them in english. The young couple is friendly and helpful; the wife speaks
french and calls a taxi service for me.</p>
<p>The cost for the taxi to come from Malmedy and then take me to the bike shop in
Sourbrodt is 40 euros. It&rsquo;s a 45min walk, so I opt to walk.</p>
<p>It was not a thrilling walk. I&rsquo;ve been spending more time walking my bike than
riding it at this point. I&rsquo;m glad I opted to wear hiking boots for my ride.</p>
<p>Arriving at the shop I go inside and speak with a lady behind the counter,
explaining in french that I need two innertubes and a pump. After buying them,
I head outside to put on my new innertube. This is the third innertube I&rsquo;ve put
on my bike today.</p>
<p>New innertube on, I return inside to drop off the ruined tire. The french lady
I spoke with was the only woman in the shop. As I walk in, I notice that all of
the men working in the shop are speaking german. I was in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimes">german speaking
part of Belgium</a>. That would have been
helpful to know when trying to buy the new innertube.</p>
<p>I was tired and hungry and had no motivation to keep riding. I found the
nearest campsite, thankfully only 15min away, and rode there. It cost 3 euros,
and I couldn&rsquo;t have been more relieved. I bought dinner at a nearby gastation.</p>

<p>The hot shower and drinking water made the 3 euros well worth it.</p>
