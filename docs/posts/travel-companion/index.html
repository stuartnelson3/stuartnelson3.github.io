				<p><strong>Location</strong>: Givet -&gt; Revin</p>
<p>Today was planned as an easy day. The voie verte route starts in Givet and
passes right through Revin. In total, I was going to bike about 35km of the
route to reach my destination.</p>
<p>Within about 20min of leaving, I rode past a guy with a touring setup similar
to mine while he was having some water. A bit later I stopped to take a picture
and he rolled past me.</p>

<p>This continued for a while: one would take a picture, the other would drink
some water. We finally both stopped at the same bridge when crossing into
Fumay, and started talking.</p>

<p>His name is Ward. He&rsquo;s dutch, but living in the flemish part of Belgium. Since
we&rsquo;re both going the same direction, he suggested we ride together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to Revin, which at this point is only 10km away. He&rsquo;s going all the
way to the end of the voie verte, Charleville-Mézières.</p>
<p>He started in the morning from Dinant, a full 20km further north of Givet, my
starting point. His route for the day was 100km, a bit further than my 35km. As
he would say later, 100km days aren&rsquo;t sustainable. 35km is pretty short though.</p>
<p>We talked the whole time we rode. I shared my story (Berlin, programming,
american, etc.), and he his (dutch in Belgium, just graduated, biking until the
weather forces him to stop. His goal? Interlaken in Switzerland.)</p>
<p>We talked about american culture and politics, belgian culture and politics,
the pandemic. He and his girlfriend are building a house. She was traveling
with him until just recently; he is doing the last two weeks alone. He
regretted having a two person tent for just himself. After they&rsquo;ve finished the
house (~1 year), he&rsquo;ll fiure out what to do with his mechanical engineering
degree.</p>
<p>Since they&rsquo;re building a house, I asked if they were getting married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. We&rsquo;re only 22. We&rsquo;re too young for marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It always seemed to me like the two were pretty closely related. But that&rsquo;s
just my perspective.</p>
<p>We reached my campsite, and as I was about to ask him if he wanted to grab some
food before he continued, he asked me the same. We grabbed sandwiches from a
bakery and found a bench overlooking the river to sit on.</p>
<p>His english was excellent. He took 10 years of french,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> but couldn&rsquo;t
remember much. He found german and english easier. It sounds like the
french-speaking and dutch-speaking belgians are converging on english for
communicating together (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s neutral since neither speak it natively&rdquo;). He
conceded that it&rsquo;s probably easier for the flemish to learn english.</p>
<p>Ward reflected on learning english and how much of an advantage it is to be a
native speaker. I can go to so many far-flung parts of the world, meet foreign
people, and we share essentially the same language.</p>
<p>His list for dutch is the Netherlands, Belgium (only the top half), and South
Africa. The list for english is a bit longer.</p>
<p>We finished our sandwiches (mine was actually a quiche lorraine), shook hands,
and parted ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you around,&rdquo; I said to him wryly.</p>
