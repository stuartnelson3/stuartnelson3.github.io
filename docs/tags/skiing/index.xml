      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: Mestia&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first day started with a short avalanche rescue refresher: using beacons,&#xA;digging, that sort of thing. After we finished that, we had a short tour (~900&#xA;vertical meters), rode ~350m down, then climbed back up, and skied out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img style=&#34;max-width: 90%; width: auto; height: auto;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://stuartnelson.xyz/images/first-day-blue-sky.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;blue sky with a snowy foreground&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;As far as &#34;easy first day tours&#34; go, this one was nice.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ski out took us back through the village we had initially walked through.&#xA;It was fun, but also full of cow shit. And, surprise, also the cows. The cows&#xA;decided to congregate around our vehicles, which made it difficult to take our&#xA;skis off and walk the final bit back. Second most cow-shit I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to&#xA;wash off my ski boots after a tour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: Innsbruck -&amp;gt; Munich -&amp;gt; Tbilisi -&amp;gt; Mestia&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Train from Innsbruck to Munich, flight from Munich to Tbilisi, taxi to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was chaos leaving the airport. Everyone tries to get you into their taxi. I&#xA;was told to book with bolt, and uber-esque app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The drivers ask you where you are going, and when you say you are going to book&#xA;with bolt, they say &amp;ldquo;yes, yes I have bolt!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: Innsbruck&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feb 19: The plan was to fly to Georgia direct from Munich on Feb 20 at 21:45,&#xA;land in Tbilisi, Georgia, at 04.45, shuttle to the hostel, nap, sauna and&#xA;massage, city tour, and then hang out in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;German airport groundcrews were on strike only on Feb 20, for the entire day. I&#xA;saw the email and text from Lufthansa Feb 19 in the morning (they sent it the&#xA;previous evening, Sunday). After a couple hours of trying to rebook via the&#xA;Lufthansa site, I got a flight for the day after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
