      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to have fairly vivid dreams. They also can be pretty crazy. So I&amp;rsquo;m going&#xA;to attempt to write them down and maybe throw out a little analysis. Some of&#xA;them are pretty clear; some are not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My goal is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remember some of these dreams and what my subconscious was going through at&#xA;the time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be able to come back to perhaps come up with a better interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-dream&#34;&gt;The Dream&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first dream in this series is pretty straight forward, as far as I can tell.&#xA;I was in my family&amp;rsquo;s cabin up in northern Minnesota with a good friend, and we&#xA;were hanging out watching tv or something.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was the middle of the day and&#xA;sunny outside, but the windows were mostly covered with cobwebs and dust. The&#xA;light still managed to show through into the cabin. Outside, after I brushed&#xA;away some of the dust and cobwebs, I could see on either side of the cabin a&#xA;young family playing in the sun. Something like a standard&#xA;father/mother/children setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
