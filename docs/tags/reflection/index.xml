      <title>Self Pressure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like all the things I want are the primary causes of stress in my&#xA;life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I just didn&amp;rsquo;t try for these things, I&amp;rsquo;d have a much simpler and less&#xA;stressful life. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely taking me from what I would rather be doing,&#xA;but I think the &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;d rather be doing in Berlin are a local maximum&#xA;for what I could be doing with my time, vs. what I&amp;rsquo;m hoping will be a higher&#xA;level of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Paycheck Disconnect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post was inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metropolismag.com/homepage/future100-commons/&#34;&gt;Future100: Design Students Rethink the&#xA;Commons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I finished reading the above post, I reached the final section that was&#xA;listing the architects who had been mentioned, and where they hailed from. At&#xA;that moment, when I thought about life as a professor at a university (not&#xA;that any of the people mentioned are professors, it&amp;rsquo;s just the idea as it&#xA;occurred to me), I was thinking about how they feel about their salary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reconnecting With a Friend</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Charleville-Mézière -&amp;gt; Reims&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, Reims is pronounced like &amp;ldquo;Raas&amp;rdquo;. Or so. Knowing that would have been&#xA;helpful when telling people where I was going. &amp;ldquo;Remmes&amp;rdquo;, as I had been&#xA;pronouncing it, does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a very slow start to the day. My bus to Reims left at 15:27, and there&#xA;wasn&amp;rsquo;t much going on in CM on a saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bus to Reims was uneventful. I listened to, for the umpteenth time, Colour&#xA;Haze&amp;rsquo;s self-titled album. It was as always a treat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Revin -&amp;gt; Charleville-Mézière&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ride today was a non-event. It was 44km of, again, pristine paved voie&#xA;verte. I reached my destination very quickly. Along the way I passed several&#xA;little pillboxes facing north upriver. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it was to harass an attempt&#xA;at nazi incursion into france.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img style=&#34;max-width: 100%; width: auto; height: auto;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/voie_verte_pillbox.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;a pillbox along the river&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;small&gt;At most soldiers stationed inside could have harried incoming transports. I&#39;m guessing they were primarily there to inform of an invasion.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By noon I was in Charleville-Mézière. I had a whole day to be in the city. It&#xA;was by far the largest place I had been in for almost two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Another Rest Day</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Revin -&amp;gt; Monthermé -&amp;gt; Tournavaux -&amp;gt; Revin&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I was going to stay in the area and go for a hike. The river was flanked&#xA;by fantastically forested hills, the sky was clear, and the temperature peaked&#xA;at 24C (sweet, sweet respite).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original path I looked at turned out to be for mountain bikes. And, at&#xA;20km, it was more than I wanted to hike on a day off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Friendly Detour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: Jemelle -&amp;gt; Houyot -&amp;gt; Beauraing -&amp;gt; Givet&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I woke up to being a little cold and it being mostly dark. How? But how? It&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;17C! I checked my phone: 6:30am. Ah, well I still got 8 hours of sleep. I&#xA;snoozed until 8:30am. The bike repair shop (remember I had unhooked my front&#xA;brakes?) didn&amp;rsquo;t open until 9:30am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got up and packed. My breakfast was 3 belgian waffles and the remaining brown&#xA;beer from Saint Monon. They went together really well. I tried to find the guy&#xA;running the junkyard/campsite, but he was nowhere to be found. I&amp;rsquo;m now probably&#xA;wanted in the area for not paying the one euro for the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Going for a Hike</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; La Roche-en-Ardenne&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After yesterday&amp;rsquo;s complete rest day, I found a &amp;ldquo;challenging&amp;rdquo; hike in the area&#xA;using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.komoot.com/discover&#34;&gt;komoot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either their algorithm for calculting difficulty is off&#xA;(probable) or I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in a lot better shape (less likely). The 10-ish km I&#xA;hiked were not challenging; I hardly broke a sweat. It was all in the&#xA;forest, which was nice, but absent more than the occasional hilly view, not&#xA;much was going on. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to shower after the hike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; La Roche-en-Ardenne&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Corneal and Joke left before I woke up. They were super nice; I was bummed I&#xA;didn&amp;rsquo;t get to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The night before they told me to go to the tourist center and grab a RAVeL map,&#xA;short for route à vélo longue. I had been following some of these routes&#xA;without knowing it, and having an official map sounded like a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;La Roche-en-Ardenne is such a cute town. I paid for two more nights at the&#xA;campsite, planning to rest in town today and hike in the area tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Berlin&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Officially I&amp;rsquo;ve been unemployed for one week. Because I was still in my&#xA;apartment, still working (small project generating sales reports for bräugier),&#xA;still leading my normal life, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel like anything had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening I handed over my keys to my apartment, put my bags on my bike, and became homeless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m staying two nights with Lukas, but officially, I have no place of my own)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
