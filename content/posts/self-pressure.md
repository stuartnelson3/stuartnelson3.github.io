It seems like all the things I want are the primary causes of stress in my
life.

If I just didn't try for these things, I'd have a much simpler and less
stressful life. It's definitely taking me from what I would rather be doing,
but I think the "things" I'd rather be doing in Berlin are a local maximum
for what I could be doing with my time, vs. what I'm hoping will be a higher
level of happiness.

**Note:**
For this post, I'm experimenting with embedding bandcamp links. So here
you go, have a listen. If you like music, you should buy it from [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/).

Stay loose, stay wild, stay free.

# Dual Citizenship

I'm currently attempting to get dual citizenship (I'm American, and going for
German citizenship). If I were to just follow the desires of Germany and
relinquish my American citizenship in favor of German citizenship, this would
be super easy. Because I want to have both, I need to also prove that it's in
Germany's interest to have me as a citizen, but that it's also greatly in my
interest to remain American (for work or whatever other reasons).

In addition to that, I have to take a language test (B2, looks like it'll be
easy), and the citizenship test (33 questions multiple choice, 17/33 is a
pass). No part of this seems difficult, but having these as tests of my
abilities with the possibility of failure definitely create a level of stress
that I otherwise wouldn't have.

Now, for this level of stress (short term, honestly quite minimal), the
positive outcome would be worth so much. To be a citizen of the EU and
America would guarantee me the ability to live across a massive area of the
world, and if I were to have children (if), they would also be guaranteed
these citizenships, in additional to any others they may get based on my
partner/location at that time. If I get dual citizenship I can definitely see
myself either picking up stakes and heading elsewhere in the EU, or at least
seriously considering investing in a second place while maintaining my fairly
cheap and well situated apartment in Berlin.

# Speculative Part-time Work

I'm working full time at [elastic.co](https://elastic.co) but also 6 hours a week or
so for a local brewery. It's really not many hours at the end of the week,
but it's definitely an effort on a Saturday or Sunday to say "Ok, now I have
to work for a few hours" when I really don't feel like it. I'm not being
paid, but I suppose I'm viewing it as any other investment. Most likely
nothing will come of it, but if for some reason it transitions into something
larger, having that early-stage foot in the door would be awesome.

# Summary

Clearly it makes sense to do these things now. That doesn't mean I'm not
looking forward to them being done, though. Here's to me writing in a few
months about how I have my german citizenship..
