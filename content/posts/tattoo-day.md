**Location:** Warsaw

I had a tattoo appointment today.

## On my tattoo selection

I originally wanted a tattoo for my proposed trip to vietnam, which was meant
to be happening at this point in time.[^1] As that trip had been scuttled and
I still wanted a tattoo, I started looking through a [best tattoo
shop](http://streetwise.pl/2019/03/06/15-tattoo-studios-in-warsaw-you-should-know-about/)
list for warsaw. I looked through dozens of artists' instagram pages.

I didn't know what I wanted. I have a short list of tattoo ideas I've been
growing the last few years, but I feel no pressure to get them.[^2]

Looking at the instagram pages, I was blown away by the quality of the
tattoos these artists were putting out. Warsaw is home to some supremely
talented people. For comparison, I had done a similar search for artists in
salzburg and was underwhelmed. Poland does it better.

I've had on my tattoo list some sort of odin the wanderer / gandalf character
for a while. All the tattoo examples I had seen were always too detailed or
too big for my personal taste. As I was scrolling through another instagram
profile (I had easily gone through over a dozen at this point. I can usually
dismiss an artist as 'not my style' immediately, but still enjoy looking at
their work), I came across a style that was mostly borderless shading. Very
cool. I immediately [loved the
style](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hO1iVHXzW/), and as I scrolled further,
I encountered [a fantastic gandalf](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqnGXlUHeJK/)
that fit my taste perfectly: black and gray, simple but with great shading,
and unquestionably gandalf while still maintaining a wonderful economy of
lines. I had already made up my mind to contact the artist, but continued
scrolling and found a [delightful
character](https://www.instagram.com/p/BW0KMTAluBo/) that had the same key
iconography as gandalf -- pointed cap, cloak, traveling pack. The artist had
done [several](https://www.instagram.com/p/BelCVQPH2pD/)
[cool](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCQ60EVHDmf/)
[variations](https://www.instagram.com/p/BenuNZJnG0R/). I decided I wanted
one without even knowing who this little wanderer was.

I shared the image with friends and a swedish one exclaimed "Snusmumriken!"

Turns out he's a swedish/finnish children's book character, a wandering nomad
with only the possessions on his back. It was perfect. I read one of the
books and saw no reason not to get him. His name in english is Snufkin.

## Getting the tattoo

Tattoo time. I was excited, to say the least. I walked into the shop, had my
temperature taken (covid), filled out the waiver forms, and sat down with the
artist to go over the sketch she had drawn.

When we spoke on instagram I initially wasn't really sure what I wanted.
Having had a week to mull it over I had changed my mind a bit. Working with
Ola, the artist, was so cool. She had the sketch on her iPad. As we spoke she
highlighted layers on the sketch, deleted parts, changed others -- it was all
so fluid. It was very cool to see her work and be a part of the process as it
happened.

</div>

We finished the design, she printed out four sizes, and I looked at how they
sat on my thigh. Originally when we spoke I gave her the option of the side
of my ribs, or my thigh, and she chose thigh. Something about the placement
wasn't doing it for me, though. I took one of the print-outs and placed it on
the inside of my calf. It fit great, sitting right on the muscle and not
spilling over on to my shin bone. I also really liked the idea that as my
calf flexed while I walked, he would be walking too. Ola flipped the image
and printed it out (reflection over the y-axis), and we headed in to the
studio.

Ola was shy about speaking english at first. When I told her I was american
she was mortified that she would have to talk with a native speaker in her
imperfect english. I was totally cool about it, and even enjoyed how we had
mime words to each other, and she relaxed pretty quick when she realized I
was having fun.

We seemed to develop an easy back and forth conversation immediately. At the
start she was laughing so much I was wondering how my tattoo was going to
turn out.

Her tattoo machine was wireless. I had never seen that before and told her
how cool it was. She asked me if I had ever used one. I said no. She asked if
I wanted to try. I said of course.

She gave me gloves and showed me how to hold my skin taut for tattooing. I
held the tattoo machine and, not knowing what to draw, opted for a little
line above the stencil of snufkin on my calf. She told me I needed to put the
needle deeper into my skin. So I did another line. Well, I had come this far,
so I did two more. It didn't hurt. Afterwards I handed the tattoo machine
back and she resumed tattooing, I watched more closely how she did it (funny
that I had never really paid attention after already having five tattoos),
like how she stabilized her hand by holding her pinky out on my leg. I made a
mental note to do that the next time I tattoo myself, and not just have my
arm free in the air.

She asked me how old I was. I said 32. I asked her how old she was.

"You can't ask that! You can guess. But be nice."<br>
_Ola waves tattoo machine threateningly_<br>
"If I don't like your guess, I draw sad little dick next to Snufkin."<br>
"Erm, 27?"<br>

She did not draw a sad little dick next to Snufkin.

After relating this story to a friend, he asked "did you tell her you already
had one?"

We talked about our families, their expectations, our lives (she bought a
camper van and is planning on just living out of it and driving it around
europe), books, movies. She got really shy again when a coworker came into
the room where we were. She was embarrassed about her english when she didn't
need to be.

She had my try to repeat some polish phrases, including polish tongue
twisters. She and her coworker were laughing out loud at how bad I was. She
even started crying she was laughing so hard. She said she would make a
recording of me and listen in the mornings when she got up.

This was easily the best experience getting tattoo'd that I've had. I think
she had an awesome time too. She gave me a big hug when I left, and told me
to message her on Sunday and she'd show me around.

I can't imagine anyone not having a great time in Poland. The people, the
food, the history, the culture. It's a really great place. Ola told me during
my tattoo that she had a different appointment for that day, but because the
person lives in Warsaw, she had bumped it to two weeks later so I could get
my tattoo.

As I was leaving I checked my phone. A friend had sent me several
recommendations for places to eat. At this point pizza sounded really good. I
decided to go to [nonna pizzeria](https://goo.gl/maps/Kha2S9WyCcgaYSc69),
which was great.

Feeling like it'd be good to get out, I found a cocktail bar that looked
cool. It was steampunk-themed. The cocktails were excellent.

After a couple exceedingly good drinks, I headed back to my airbnb.

    I had even found and contacted an artist on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/black.fishhh/). His stuff looks
    awesome, and I'm still hoping to get something from him.

[^2]:
    The oldest on the list is actually a line from the aeneid, which I've
    been contemplating since 2011: 'stat sua cuique dies'. As much as I think it
    would be cool, I imagine it'd drive me crazy having to explain the meaning to
    every single person who saw it.
