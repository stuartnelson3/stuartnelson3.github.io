**Location:** Bastogne

I woke up feeling like something was off.

Not so much wanderlust as much as fernweh, despite being away from "home".
When I left the house last night for dinner, my hostess was watching tv on
the couch. Maybe it's the fact that I'm simply in a home that's bothering me.
Which is a weird thing to contemplate.

I walked to the bastogne war museum. I thought it was about the battle of the
bulge, but it covered the run up to WW2, starting with the end of WW1, and
all the way through to the war's end.

It was engaging and informative without being exhausting. You follow the
story of four people through the war -- a nazi soldier, an american soldier,
a belgian boy (~13 years old) and a belgian woman (~25 years old).

Their stories all intersect, and the narrative is well resolved at the end.
This was not the best museum I've been to (that honor remains with the Polin
Jewish History museum in Warsaw), but it was still a very good museum.

Frank, my ride back to berlin, messaged me to say the covid numbers out of
the netherlands, our proposed route back, look bad. If germany puts a
quarantine requirement on travelers returning from there he won't come. This
would be unfortunate. Not only would I have a very long way home (there are
no nearby german cities with good connections to take me back), but I am also
waiting here several days specifically for him. Hopefully he can come.

## Side Reflection

I want to do something. I have the energy and the motivation and desire to do
something.

Before I left, working on generating reports for bräugier's sales, I was
having a great time. Owning a product soup to nuts, providing value, and
remembering some programming were all fun. Even if it was for something as
dry sounding as "generate sales reports".

Out here, with books and a bicycle, I find myself bored. I've done my
camping, cycled long distances, improvised a route, and even proved that I
can speak enough french to handle myself (enough; not a lot).

I've hit the limit of simple conquests on this trip.

There are harder problems I can address. Reflecting, writing, things that
show no progress as you scratch your neckbeard until maybe you arrive at an
answer. These problems can be felt, but getting at their source isn't clear
cut (cf. my unease at staying in a home), nor is their solution.

Am I happy so long as someone dangles a carrot on a stick ni front of my
face? Enough people, myself included, have noticed how I'm interested in
solving the problem, but lose interest when I get to the seemingly mundane
implementation of the solution. That is what feels to me like a grind.

Maybe short projects with early-stage startups, like what I did with
bräugier, or with Etienne's freelancing, would be good for me. I think though
that a key part is my relationship with the client. I was happy coding for
the brewery because I knew I was doing something valuable for friends.
Unfortunately, the majority of my friends aren't working at early-stage
startups.

## The Magic Flight

Just heard from Frank. Turns out I have to get back on my own.
