**Location:** Warsaw

I had two things on my mind waking up:

1. Coffee with Weronika
2. Tattoo with Aleksandra (who is actually Ola)

I matched with Weronika on bumble the preceding morning. I mentioned
immediately that I was getting a tattoo the next day, she asked what shop,
and was super excited when I said Caffeine Tattoo. She had a half sleeve done
there by the shop owner (not Ola).

We hit it off immediately and texted for a couple hours, and then scheduled
coffee before my tattoo. She had to work, but that night we ended up texting
for another few hours, and seemed to be having a good time. So, naturally, I
was looking forward to meeting her.

She suggested a coffee place I had walked past on the previous day when
coming back from the warsaw uprising museum, Sacred Mill Brew Bar. I like
coffee, and appreciate good coffee, but I also spent most of summer drinking
instant coffee, so I don't appear to have the most discriminating palate.

The first online dating hurdle is if they actually look like their photos.
I've been burned by this before. Much to my relief, she looked exactly like
them. Which is a good thing.

We had coffee, shot the shit, and in general had a good time. When it was
time to mosey to my tattoo appointment, she walked with me to the shop. We
talked about what I would do after the tattoo. Clearly food and beer. I
hadn't had a beer the preceding day, and my alcoholism was not happy about
that. W said she'd text me some places I could go. She had plans that night,
so it seemed like I would maybe see her the next day or the day after.

## On my tattoo selection

I originally wanted a tattoo for my proposed trip to vietnam, which was meant
to be happening at this point in time.[^1] As that trip had been scuttled and
I still wanted a tattoo, I started looking through a [best tattoo
shop](http://streetwise.pl/2019/03/06/15-tattoo-studios-in-warsaw-you-should-know-about/)
list for warsaw. I looked through dozens of artists' instagram pages.

I didn't know what I wanted. I have a short list of tattoo ideas I've been
growing the last few years, but I feel no pressure to get them.[^2]

Looking at the instagram pages, I was blown away by the quality of the
tattoos these artists were putting out. Warsaw is home to some supremely
talented people. For comparison, I had done a similar search for artists in
salzburg and was underwhelmed. Poland does it better.

I've had on my tattoo list some sort of odin the wanderer / gandalf character
for a while. All the tattoo examples I had seen were always too detailed or
too big for my personal taste. As I was scrolling through another instagram
profile (I had easily gone through over a dozen at this point. I can usually
dismiss an artist as 'not my style' immediately, but still enjoy looking at
their work), I came across a style that was mostly borderless shading. Very
cool. I immediately [loved the
style](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9hO1iVHXzW/), and as I scrolled further,
I encountered [a fantastic gandalf](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqnGXlUHeJK/)
that fit my taste perfectly: black and gray, simple but with great shading,
and unquestionably gandalf while still maintaining a wonderful economy of
lines. I had already made up my mind to contact the artist, but continued
scrolling and found a [delightful
character](https://www.instagram.com/p/BW0KMTAluBo/) that had the same key
iconography as gandalf -- pointed cap, cloak, traveling pack. The artist had
done [several](https://www.instagram.com/p/BelCVQPH2pD/)
[cool](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCQ60EVHDmf/)
[variations](https://www.instagram.com/p/BenuNZJnG0R/). I decided I wanted
one without even knowing who this little wanderer was.

I shared the image with friends and a swedish one exclaimed "Snusmumriken!"

Turns out he's a swedish/finnish children's book character, a wandering nomad
with only the possessions on his back. It was perfect. I read one of the
books and saw no reason not to get him. His name in english is Snufkin.

## Getting the tattoo

Tattoo time. I was excited, to say the least. I walked into the shop, had my
temperature taken (covid), filled out the waiver forms, and sat down with the
artist to go over the sketch she had drawn.

When we spoke on instagram I initially wasn't really sure what I wanted.
Having had a week to mull it over I had changed my mind a bit. Working with
Ola, the artist, was so cool. She had the sketch on her iPad. As we spoke she
highlighted layers on the sketch, deleted parts, changed others -- it was all
so fluid. It was very cool to see her work and be a part of the process as it
happened.

<figcaption><small>Live sketching. Having her make suggestions, rotate the sketch, and show changes, was really cool.</small></figcaption>
</div>

We finished the design, she printed out four sizes, and I looked at how they
sat on my thigh. Originally when we spoke I gave her the option of the side
of my ribs, or my thigh, and she chose thigh. Something about the placement
wasn't doing it for me, though. I took one of the print-outs and placed it on
the inside of my calf. It fit great, sitting right on the muscle and not
spilling over on to my shin bone. I also really liked the idea that as my
calf flexed while I walked, he would be walking too. Ola flipped the image
and printed it out (reflection over the y-axis), and we headed in to the
studio.

Ola was shy about speaking english at first. When I told her I was american
she was mortified that she would have to talk with a native speaker in her
imperfect english. I was totally cool about it, and even enjoyed how we had
mime words to each other, and she relaxed pretty quick when she realized I
was having fun.

We seemed to develop an easy back and forth conversation immediately. At the
start she was laughing so much I was wondering how my tattoo was going to
turn out.

Her tattoo machine was wireless. I had never seen that before and told her
how cool it was. She asked me if I had ever used one. I said no. She asked if
I wanted to try. I said of course.

She gave me gloves and showed me how to hold my skin taut for tattooing. I
held the tattoo machine and, not knowing what to draw, opted for a little
line above the stencil of snufkin on my calf. She told me I needed to put the
needle deeper into my skin. So I did another line. Well, I had come this far,
so I did two more. It didn't hurt. Afterwards I handed the tattoo machine
back and she resumed tattooing, I watched more closely how she did it (funny
that I had never really paid attention after already having five tattoos),
like how she stabilized her hand by holding her pinky out on my leg. I made a
mental note to do that the next time I tattoo myself, and not just have my
arm free in the air.

</div>

She asked me how old I was. I said 32. I asked her how old she was.

"You can't ask that! You can guess. But be nice."<br>
*Ola waves tattoo machine threateningly*<br>
"If I don't like your guess, I draw sad little dick next to Snufkin."<br>
"Erm, 27?"<br>

She did not draw a sad little dick next to Snufkin.

After relating this story to a friend, he asked "did you tell her you already
had one?"

We talked about our families, their expectations, our lives (she bought a
camper van and is planning on just living out of it and driving it around
europe), books, movies. She got really shy again when a coworker came into
the room where we were. She was embarrassed about her english when she didn't
need to be.

She had my try to repeat some polish phrases, including polish tongue
twisters. She and her coworker were laughing out loud at how bad I was. She
even started crying she was laughing so hard. She said she would make a
recording of me and listen in the mornings when she got up.

This was easily the best experience getting tattoo'd that I've had. I think
she had an awesome time too. She gave me a big hug when I left, and told me
to message her on Sunday and she'd show me around.

I can't imagine anyone not having a great time in Poland. The people, the
food, the history, the culture. It's a really great place. Ola told me during
my tattoo that she had a different appointment for that day, but because the
person lives in Warsaw, she had bumped it to two weeks later so I could get
my tattoo.

As I was leaving I checked my phone. Weronika had sent me several
recommendations for places to eat. At this point pizza sounded really good.
She also said she would be done with work soon and could swing by to pick me
up. I told her pizza sounded great so we decided to meet at [nonna
pizzeria](https://goo.gl/maps/Kha2S9WyCcgaYSc69).

The pizza was great. She was great. It was an excellent meal. She had drinks
with friends at 8, so we started walking that way. At an intersection I
started to turn to go back to my place, and she said I could keep walking her
to the bar. It was absolutely no where near my apartment, but when a smart
pretty funny girl ask you to walk her somewhere, you say yes.

I dropped her off and started walking back, 45min to get home. The evening
was calm and cool and I was happy to walk.

She texted to thank me for having a good time that day. I thanked her also,
and wished her a nice evening.

30 minutes later she texted again to see if I weanted to get drinks later
that night. I had just gotten home and was settling in for some TV, but again
-- smart, pretty, funny. She said to meet at
[Bardziej](https://goo.gl/maps/84D4BRjztnxyQomo6), 45min back in the
direction I had just left.

It was a steampunk-themed cocktail bar. The cocktails were great. The company
was pretty cool, too.

</div>

I arrived before her and went inside to sit. She arrived and came in, then
asked me if I wanted to join her and her friend while they had a cigarrette.
I went out with her and joked with them. We ended up mostly teasing Weronika,
which was probably not what she had planned. Cigarettes finished, we bid her
friend goodnight and went in for drinks.

We continued to talk. We went through our list of bad online dating stories;
we talked about my plans for the rest of my trip (at this point I was still
planning on going to Krakow on Monday). She had a driving class at 9am the
next morning. At 2am, after several cocktails that I still think about (they
were that good), we headed out. We hugged, said goodnight, and she got an
uber home.

I walked the 45min back to my apartment listening to the same songs as on the way there.

[^1]: I had even found and contacted an artist on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/black.fishhh/). His stuff looks
awesome, and I'm still hoping to get something from him.
[^2]: The oldest on the list is actually a line from the aeneid, which I've
been contemplating since 2011: 'stat sua cuique dies'. As much as I think it
would be cool, I imagine it'd drive me crazy having to explain the meaning to
every single person who saw it.
