**Location:** Berlin -> Warsaw

The train from Berlin to Warsaw was less than eventful. The train was direct,
I had some music, and they were handing out free water. Couldn't be easier.

After a simple airbnb check-in, I scoped out a route to the tourist area full
of restaurants I remembered from my previous trip, and headed out to find
some dinner.

Poland has this concept called a "milk bar". Originally serving dairy
products, they now (and for a long time) serve all sorts of traditional
polish foods -- cabbage, potatoes, breaded fried pork cutlets, pierogi -- at
a crazy low, government-subsidized, cost.

At the recommendation of a polish friend, I knew I wanted this to be my first
meal on my return to warsaw (I didn't go during my previous trip).

As I approached the restaurant, an old man standing outside asked me to buy
him soup. I declined and headed into the restaurant.

Stepping inside felt like entering a polish take on a chinese dimsum
restaurant, but inside a tiny old gambling hall cleared of slot machines and
video poker.

I stood contemplating the expansive, all polish, wall-mounted menu and
remembered I didn't know any polish. I could pick out the soups (zupy),
cutlets (kotlet), and pierogi (pierogi), but other than that I was lost.

As I pretended like staring at the menu would reveal to me the meaning of the
menu items, the old guy from before walked into the milk bar and asked me
again for soup. Seeing that it was only one euro, I said I would get it for
him. I tried to ask him what I should get for myself. He seemed to understand
what I was getting at, so we walked over to the order window and I tried to
say the name of something that he had recommended to me.

I butchered the pronunciation so badly that the old guy started laughing out
loud. He took over and ordered his soup, and then a cutlet and pierogi for
me. He asked if I wanted a drink. I said "piwo?" hopefully (piwo is the word
for beer in most eastern european languages), but he laughed again.
Apparently there's no beer in the milk bar. They asked if I wanted a pepsi
but I decided against it.

I paid and we shuffled over about three feet from the order window to the
pickup window. The old guy started talking to me in polish. At one point he
appeared to ask if I were english. I told him I was american. He did a bit of
a face palm, kept talking in polish, and seemed to start in on a short
diatribe about how covid-19 doesn't exist or is overblown. I nodded along,
able to neither agree nor deny any of his claims. His soup was ready first, so
he grabbed it from the window, went to a table, sat down, and ate. My food
showed up a couple minutes later. I sat at a different table.

When he finished his soup he thanked me and left. I checked my phone and saw
that both my meals and his soup cost seven euros.

I bought a couple beers on the way back to my airbnb and settled in for the
evening.
