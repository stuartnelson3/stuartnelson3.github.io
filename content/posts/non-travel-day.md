**Location**: Innsbruck

Feb 19: The plan was to fly to Georgia direct from Munich on Feb 20 at 21:45,
land in Tbilisi, Georgia, at 04.45, shuttle to the hostel, nap, sauna and
massage, city tour, and then hang out in the city.

German airport groundcrews were on strike only on Feb 20, for the entire day. I
saw the email and text from Lufthansa Feb 19 in the morning (they sent it the
previous evening, Sunday). After a couple hours of trying to rebook via the
Lufthansa site, I got a flight for the day after.

If I arrived in Georgia after Feb 22, I would have had to arrange a shuttle to
drive the 8 hours to Mestia on my own.

Looking at my phone photos, this is the only picture I have from that day:
