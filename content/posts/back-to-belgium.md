**Location:** Reims -> Charleville-Mézière -> Fumay -> Ochamp

I'm returning to camping today. And biking. I've literally only been away
from it for two days, but the whole idea already seems weird. And I had been
camping for two weeks.

Rain and storms are coming in the rest of the week, starting in a day or two.
At great financial cost (comparatively .. 40EUR/night vs. camping for
~5EUR/night) I took a room in Bastogne for the remainder of the trip. There's
a lot of history there. Also, with the rain coming and no real destination
beyond that, having a warm room and being able to liesurely visit the town
for a few days sounds nice. Frank arrives friday, and then we head to the
netherlands (and the bismut concert) on saturday.

I made a bit of a logistics error. I took the train to fumay and crossed
massive hills to get to ochamp. I should have gone to sedan, saved myself
about 20km of cycling, and probably a good deal of elevation gain.

I ended up sleeping in the woods. As the trip started, so the trip ends. The
bivouac site is 2km away from where I am, but the path was basically
bushwhacking the entire way. After about 70km of cycling with lots of
elevation change, running out of water, and decent heat, I was done. Tomorrow
is an extremely easy cycle on a paved ravel route, and I felt like I was
ready to rest.

I called Bert to tell him I wouldn't make it to see him. He appreciated me calling to let him know. He seems nice.

Reading about hemingway's trip with f. scott fitzgerald in "a moveable feast"
makes me realize all my challenges, troubles, and frustrations are just a
part of a worthwhile adventure.
