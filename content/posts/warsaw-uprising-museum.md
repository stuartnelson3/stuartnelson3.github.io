**Location:** Warsaw

**Note to the reader:** I only wrote a single sentence for this day's entry,
despite having gone to the Warsaw Uprising museum. I've included that
sentence, but this is a post almost entirely of pictures.

_You can miss something but not want it._

Putting myself in this situation, receiving supplies from a foreign country in the middle of a war, it must have been incredibly powerful to know that your countrymen a world away were bleeding for you.</small></figcaption>

<figcaption><small>This is the soldier whom I resemble. This is up for debate. You stand in front of the reflective pillar, position your face according to the prompts, and then it shows you a face. I did it twice and got to different results.</small></figcaption>
