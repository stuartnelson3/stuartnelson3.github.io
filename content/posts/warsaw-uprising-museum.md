**Location:** Warsaw

**Note to the reader:** I only wrote a single sentence for this day's entry,
despite having gone to the Warsaw Uprising museum. I've included that
sentence, but this is a post almost entirely of pictures.

*You can miss something but not want it.*

Putting myself in this situation, receiving supplies from a foreign country in the middle of a war, it must have been incredibly powerful to know that your countrymen a world away were bleeding for you.</small></figcaption>
