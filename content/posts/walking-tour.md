**Location:** Warsaw

There's an awesome market hall right by my airbnb, Hala Mirowska. I grabbed a
large rectangular pastry filled with cheese and spinach for breakfast. They
had about 8 different kinds, and I want to try tme all.

I took a long walk to the reconstructed old town, and walked from its
southernmost end up to the northernmost, then headed back south on a path
along the river. The original old town was razed by the nazis as punishment
for the warsaw uprising. The reconstruction is charming and great to walk
through. Within the old town, only polish citizens are allowed to own
property (as I was told). There are enough restaurants to keep someone busy
for weeks. It's definitely the highest density tourist area. Other than
polish, the language I heard most often was german (guided tours).

I walked through the university to Cafe Kafka, where Jimmy, Marlies, Aleks
and I commonly had a coffee and cake or breakfast, and played cards.

Covid or not, the cafe hasn't changed in the last three years. It's right on
the edge of what seems to be the main cluster of university buildings. While
most of the clientele appear to be students, it never seems to be more than
comfortably full.
