      <title>Nuts!</title>

      <description>Location: Bastogne
I woke up feeling like something was off.
Not so much wanderlust as much as fernweh, despite being away from &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;. When I left the house last night for dinner, my hostess was watching tv on the couch. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m simply in a home that&amp;rsquo;s bothering me. Which is a weird thing to contemplate.
I walked to the bastogne war museum. I thought it was about the battle of the bulge, but it covered the run up to WW2, starting with the end of WW1, and all the way through to the war&amp;rsquo;s end.</description>

      <title>No More Camping</title>

      <description>Location: Ochamp -&amp;gt; Bastogne
Not much to say about today. I woke up around 8am. My destination was only 2 hours away, and the check-in time was 5pm.
I hung out at my &amp;ldquo;campsite&amp;rdquo; reading and watching &amp;ldquo;no reservations&amp;rdquo; until noon or so. I had three pints left over from the previous day, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to bike with that with me. So there was some morning drinking.
The ride followed a &amp;ldquo;pre&amp;rdquo; ravel route.</description>

      <description>Location: Reims -&amp;gt; Charleville-Mézière -&amp;gt; Fumay -&amp;gt; Ochamp
I&amp;rsquo;m returning to camping today. And biking. I&amp;rsquo;ve literally only been away from it for two days, but the whole idea already seems weird. And I had been camping for two weeks.
Rain and storms are coming in the rest of the week, starting in a day or two. At great financial cost (comparatively .. 40EUR/night vs. camping for ~5EUR/night) I took a room in Bastogne for the remainder of the trip.</description>

      <title>A Day in Reims</title>

      <description>Location: Reims
I woke up and had coffee in the airbnb. That was a delightful way to start the day. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be interesting going back to camping, albeit for only one night.
I started considering my next residence after this bike trip. I was planning on Warsaw / Krakow, but actually a month rental in Paris is under 1000EUR, and pretty centrally located. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely something to consider, but the cost of everything will be a lot more &amp;ndash; probably 2-3x more than Poland.</description>

      <description>Location: Givet -&amp;gt; Revin
Today was planned as an easy day. The voie verte route starts in Givet and passes right through Revin. In total, I was going to bike about 35km of the route to reach my destination.
Within about 20min of leaving, I rode past a guy with a touring setup similar to mine while he was having some water. A bit later I stopped to take a picture and he rolled past me.</description>

      <description>Location: Jemelle -&amp;gt; Houyot -&amp;gt; Beauraing -&amp;gt; Givet
I woke up to being a little cold and it being mostly dark. How? But how? It&amp;rsquo;s 17C! I checked my phone: 6:30am. Ah, well I still got 8 hours of sleep. I snoozed until 8:30am. The bike repair shop (remember I had unhooked my front brakes?) didn&amp;rsquo;t open until 9:30am.
I got up and packed. My breakfast was 3 belgian waffles and the remaining brown beer from Saint Monon.</description>

      <title>Off to the Brewery</title>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne -&amp;gt; Hotton -&amp;gt; Jemelle
I originally had scheduled 90 km for today. Then, upon seeing the high temp for the day (32C), I scaled it back to 50km. I arrived in Jemelle feeling good. I even did another 15km rountrip to get beer from Saint Monon Brewery, but now I can feel the ride.
I followed the EV5 bike route the entire way, an international European route. Well marked, well maintained, it was good riding.</description>

      <description>Location: Viersalm -&amp;gt; La Roche-en-Ardenne
&amp;ldquo;Jettison some weight, or I&amp;rsquo;ll never make it to Cybertron!&amp;rdquo;
Astrotrain couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more right.
The day started well, despite a 9C night that woke me up cold. Tonight it will be cold again, but the nights get warmer after that. I&amp;rsquo;ll try stuffing extra clothing into my sleeping bag tonight to keep warm. Like a hobo.1
My plan for today was to head to Saint-Hubert.</description>

      <description>Location: Sourbrodt -&amp;gt; Viersalm
It rained several times in the night. Despite my inability as an outdoorsman, my tarp kept me dry. Except for waking up cold between 5am and 7am (cf. previous comment on bivouac sacks), I slept well.
I broke camp around 9:30am. I had only drunk two of the three beers from the previous night, so I had a Leffe with breakfast. Breakfast was a bit of peanut butter with some dried cranberries.</description>

      <description>Location: Lac Gileppe -&amp;gt; Sourbrodt
I broke camp early and ate my leftover sandwich that I bought in Aachen HBF. It was bread and camembert, and would become my diet for the next three weeks (although I did not know this at the time).
The biking was brutal uphill. I had been &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; in the previous months, but 15 sets of 3min hill runs do not come close to preparing you for a 2.</description>

      <description>Location: Berlin -&amp;gt; Aachen -&amp;gt; Lac Gileppe
Long travel day. After a tearful goodbye with my hetero life partner Lukas, we were off to the races. Berlin HBF to be exact.
The train from HBF to Bad Oeynhausen (yeah, seriously) was easy. From there, transfer to a regional train to Düsseldorf HBF. This is where it got interesting.
Halfway through the three or so hour ride, there was a train blocking the track (between Oelde and Neubeckum).</description>

      <title>First Day Homeless</title>

      <description>Location: Berlin
Officially I&amp;rsquo;ve been unemployed for one week. Because I was still in my apartment, still working (small project generating sales reports for bräugier), still leading my normal life, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel like anything had changed.
Yesterday evening I handed over my keys to my apartment, put my bags on my bike, and became homeless.
(I&amp;rsquo;m staying two nights with Lukas, but officially, I have no place of my own)</description>
