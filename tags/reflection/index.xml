I woke up to being a little cold and it being mostly dark. How? But how? It&amp;rsquo;s 17C! I checked my phone: 6:30am. Ah, well I still got 8 hours of sleep. I snoozed until 8:30am. The bike repair shop (remember I had unhooked my front brakes?) didn&amp;rsquo;t open until 9:30am.
I got up and packed. My breakfast was 3 belgian waffles and the remaining brown beer from Saint Monon.</description>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne
After yesterday&amp;rsquo;s complete rest day, I found a &amp;ldquo;challenging&amp;rdquo; hike in the area using komoot.
Either their algorithm for calculting difficulty is off (probable) or I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in a lot better shape (less likely). The 10-ish km I hiked were not challenging; I hardly broke a sweat. It was all in the forest, which was nice, but absent more than the occasional hilly view, not much was going on.</description>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne
Corneal and Joke left before I woke up. They were super nice; I was bummed I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to say goodbye.
The night before they told me to go to the tourist center and grab a RAVeL map, short for route à vélo longue. I had been following some of these routes without knowing it, and having an official map sounded like a good idea.
La Roche-en-Ardenne is such a cute town.</description>

      <description>Location: Berlin
Officially I&amp;rsquo;ve been unemployed for one week. Because I was still in my apartment, still working (small project generating sales reports for bräugier), still leading my normal life, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel like anything had changed.
Yesterday evening I handed over my keys to my apartment, put my bags on my bike, and became homeless.
(I&amp;rsquo;m staying two nights with Lukas, but officially, I have no place of my own)</description>
