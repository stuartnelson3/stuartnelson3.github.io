      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne
Corneal and Joke left before I woke up. They were super nice; I was bummed I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to say goodbye.
The night before they told me to go to the tourist center and grab a RAVeL map, short for route à vélo longue. I had been following some of these routes without knowing it, and having an official map sounded like a good idea.
La Roche-en-Ardenne is such a cute town.</description>

      <description>Location: Berlin
Officially I&amp;rsquo;ve been unemployed for one week. Because I was still in my apartment, still working (small project generating sales reports for bräugier), still leading my normal life, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel like anything had changed.
Yesterday evening I handed over my keys to my apartment, put my bags on my bike, and became homeless.
(I&amp;rsquo;m staying two nights with Lukas, but officially, I have no place of my own)</description>
