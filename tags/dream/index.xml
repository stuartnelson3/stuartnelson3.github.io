      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to try something new.
I tend to have fairly vivid dreams. They also can be pretty crazy. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to attempt to write them down and maybe throw out a little analysis. Some of them are pretty clear; some are not.
My goal is two-fold:
 Remember some of these dreams and what my subconscious was going through at the time Be able to come back to perhaps come up with a better interpretation.</description>
