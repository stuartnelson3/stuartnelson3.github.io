      <description>Location: Reims -&amp;gt; Charleville-Mézière -&amp;gt; Fumay -&amp;gt; Ochamp
I&amp;rsquo;m returning to camping today. And biking. I&amp;rsquo;ve literally only been away from it for two days, but the whole idea already seems weird. And I had been camping for two weeks.
Rain and storms are coming in the rest of the week, starting in a day or two. At great financial cost (comparatively .. 40EUR/night vs. camping for ~5EUR/night) I took a room in Bastogne for the remainder of the trip.</description>

      <title>A Day in Reims</title>

      <description>Location: Reims
I woke up and had coffee in the airbnb. That was a delightful way to start the day. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be interesting going back to camping, albeit for only one night.
I started considering my next residence after this bike trip. I was planning on Warsaw / Krakow, but actually a month rental in Paris is under 1000EUR, and pretty centrally located. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely something to consider, but the cost of everything will be a lot more &amp;ndash; probably 2-3x more than Poland.</description>

      <title>Reconnecting With a Friend</title>

      <description>Location: Charleville-Mézière -&amp;gt; Reims
First, Reims is pronounced like &amp;ldquo;Raas&amp;rdquo;. Or so. Knowing that would have been helpful when telling people where I was going. &amp;ldquo;Remmes&amp;rdquo;, as I had been pronouncing it, does not exist.
I had a very slow start to the day. My bus to Reims left at 15:27, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much going on in CM on a saturday morning.
The bus to Reims was uneventful. I listened to, for the umpteenth time, Colour Haze&amp;rsquo;s self-titled album.</description>

      <description>Location: Revin -&amp;gt; Charleville-Mézière
The ride today was a non-event. It was 44km of, again, pristine paved voie verte. I reached my destination very quickly. Along the way I passed several little pillboxes facing north upriver. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it was to harass an attempt at nazi incursion into france.
At most soldiers stationed inside could have harried incoming transports. I&#39;m guessing they were primarily there to inform of an invasion. By noon I was in Charleville-Mézière.</description>

      <description>Location: Revin -&amp;gt; Monthermé -&amp;gt; Tournavaux -&amp;gt; Revin
Today I was going to stay in the area and go for a hike. The river was flanked by fantastically forested hills, the sky was clear, and the temperature peaked at 24C (sweet, sweet respite).
The original path I looked at turned out to be for mountain bikes. And, at 20km, it was more than I wanted to hike on a day off.</description>

      <description>Location: Givet -&amp;gt; Revin
Today was planned as an easy day. The voie verte route starts in Givet and passes right through Revin. In total, I was going to bike about 35km of the route to reach my destination.
Within about 20min of leaving, I rode past a guy with a touring setup similar to mine while he was having some water. A bit later I stopped to take a picture and he rolled past me.</description>

      <description>Location: Jemelle -&amp;gt; Houyot -&amp;gt; Beauraing -&amp;gt; Givet
I woke up to being a little cold and it being mostly dark. How? But how? It&amp;rsquo;s 17C! I checked my phone: 6:30am. Ah, well I still got 8 hours of sleep. I snoozed until 8:30am. The bike repair shop (remember I had unhooked my front brakes?) didn&amp;rsquo;t open until 9:30am.
I got up and packed. My breakfast was 3 belgian waffles and the remaining brown beer from Saint Monon.</description>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne -&amp;gt; Hotton -&amp;gt; Jemelle
I originally had scheduled 90 km for today. Then, upon seeing the high temp for the day (32C), I scaled it back to 50km. I arrived in Jemelle feeling good. I even did another 15km rountrip to get beer from Saint Monon Brewery, but now I can feel the ride.
I followed the EV5 bike route the entire way, an international European route. Well marked, well maintained, it was good riding.</description>

      <title>Going for a Hike</title>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne
After yesterday&amp;rsquo;s complete rest day, I found a &amp;ldquo;challenging&amp;rdquo; hike in the area using komoot.
Either their algorithm for calculting difficulty is off (probable) or I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in a lot better shape (less likely). The 10-ish km I hiked were not challenging; I hardly broke a sweat. It was all in the forest, which was nice, but absent more than the occasional hilly view, not much was going on.</description>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne
Corneal and Joke left before I woke up. They were super nice; I was bummed I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to say goodbye.
The night before they told me to go to the tourist center and grab a RAVeL map, short for route à vélo longue. I had been following some of these routes without knowing it, and having an official map sounded like a good idea.
La Roche-en-Ardenne is such a cute town.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Jettison some weight, or I&amp;rsquo;ll never make it to Cybertron!&amp;rdquo;
Astrotrain couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more right.
The day started well, despite a 9C night that woke me up cold. Tonight it will be cold again, but the nights get warmer after that. I&amp;rsquo;ll try stuffing extra clothing into my sleeping bag tonight to keep warm. Like a hobo.1
My plan for today was to head to Saint-Hubert.</description>

      <description>Location: Sourbrodt -&amp;gt; Viersalm
It rained several times in the night. Despite my inability as an outdoorsman, my tarp kept me dry. Except for waking up cold between 5am and 7am (cf. previous comment on bivouac sacks), I slept well.
I broke camp around 9:30am. I had only drunk two of the three beers from the previous night, so I had a Leffe with breakfast. Breakfast was a bit of peanut butter with some dried cranberries.</description>

      <description>Location: Lac Gileppe -&amp;gt; Sourbrodt
I broke camp early and ate my leftover sandwich that I bought in Aachen HBF. It was bread and camembert, and would become my diet for the next three weeks (although I did not know this at the time).
The biking was brutal uphill. I had been &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; in the previous months, but 15 sets of 3min hill runs do not come close to preparing you for a 2.</description>

      <description>Location: Berlin -&amp;gt; Aachen -&amp;gt; Lac Gileppe
Long travel day. After a tearful goodbye with my hetero life partner Lukas, we were off to the races. Berlin HBF to be exact.
The train from HBF to Bad Oeynhausen (yeah, seriously) was easy. From there, transfer to a regional train to Düsseldorf HBF. This is where it got interesting.
Halfway through the three or so hour ride, there was a train blocking the track (between Oelde and Neubeckum).</description>
