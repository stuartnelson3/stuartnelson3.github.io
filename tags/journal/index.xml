      <description>Location: Jemelle -&amp;gt; Houyoyt -&amp;gt; Beauraing -&amp;gt; Givet
I woke up to being a little cold and it being mostly dark. How? But how? It&amp;rsquo;s 17C! I checked my phone: 6:30am. Ah, well I still got 8 hours of sleep. I snoozed until 8:30am. The bike repair shop (remember I had unhooked my front brakes?) didn&amp;rsquo;t open until 9:30am.
I got up and packed. My breakfast was 3 belgian waffles and the remaining brown beer from Saint Monon.</description>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne -&amp;gt; Hotton -&amp;gt; Jemelle
I originally had scheduled 90 km for today. Then, upon seeing the high temp for the day (32C), I scaled it back to 50km. I arrived in Jemelle feeling good. I even did another 15km rountrip to get beer from Saint Monon Brewery, but now I can feel the ride.
I followed the EV5 bike route the entire way, an international European route. Well marked, well maintained, it was good riding.</description>

      <title>Going for a Hike</title>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne
After yesterday&amp;rsquo;s complete rest day, I found a &amp;ldquo;challenging&amp;rdquo; hike in the area using komoot.
Either their algorithm for calculting difficulty is off (probable) or I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten in a lot better shape (less likely). The 10-ish km I hiked were not challenging; I hardly broke a sweat. It was all in the forest, which was nice, but absent more than the occasional hilly view, not much was going on.</description>

      <description>Location: La Roche-en-Ardenne
Corneal and Joke left before I woke up. They were super nice; I was bummed I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to say goodbye.
The night before they told me to go to the tourist center and grab a RAVeL map, short for route à vélo longue. I had been following some of these routes without knowing it, and having an official map sounded like a good idea.
La Roche-en-Ardenne is such a cute town.</description>

      <description>Location: Viersalm -&amp;gt; La Roche-en-Ardenne
&amp;ldquo;Jettison some weight, or I&amp;rsquo;ll never make it to Cybertron!&amp;rdquo;
Astrotrain couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been more right.
The day started well, despite a 9C night that woke me up cold. Tonight it will be cold again, but the nights get warmer after that. I&amp;rsquo;ll try stuffing extra clothing into my sleeping bag tonight to keep warm. Like a hobo.1
My plan for today was to head to Saint-Hubert.</description>

      <title>A Smoother Path</title>

      <description>Location: Sourbrodt -&amp;gt; Viersalm
It rained several times in the night. Despite my inability as an outdoorsman, my tarp kept me dry. Except for waking up cold between 5am and 7am (cf. previous comment on bivouac sacks), I slept well.
I broke camp around 9:30am. I had only drunk two of the three beers from the previous night, so I had a Leffe with breakfast. Breakfast was a bit of peanut butter with some dried cranberries.</description>

      <description>Location: Lac Gileppe -&amp;gt; Sourbrodt
I broke camp early and ate my leftover sandwich that I bought in Aachen HBF. It was bread and camembert, and would become my diet for the next three weeks (although I did not know this at the time).
The biking was brutal uphill. I had been &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; in the previous months, but 15 sets of 3min hill runs do not come close to preparing you for a 2.</description>

      <title>The Adventure Begins</title>

      <description>Location: Berlin -&amp;gt; Aachen -&amp;gt; Lac Gileppe
Long travel day. After a tearful goodbye with my hetero life partner Lukas, we were off to the races. Berlin HBF to be exact.
The train from HBF to Bad Oeynhausen (yeah, seriously) was easy. From there, transfer to a regional train to Düsseldorf HBF. This is where it got interesting.
Halfway through the three or so hour ride, there was a train blocking the track (between Oelde and Neubeckum).</description>
