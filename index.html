		This post was inspired by Future100: Design Students Rethink the Commons.
Background As I finished reading the above post, I reached the final section that was listing the architects who had been mentioned, and where they hailed from. At that moment, when I thought about life as a professor at a university (not that any of the people mentioned are professors, it&rsquo;s just the idea as it occurred to me), I was thinking about how they feel about their salary.

I had a tattoo appointment today.
On my tattoo selection I originally wanted a tattoo for my proposed trip to vietnam, which was meant to be happening at this point in time.1 As that trip had been scuttled and I still wanted a tattoo, I started looking through a best tattoo shop list for warsaw. I looked through dozens of artists' instagram pages.
I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted.

There&rsquo;s an awesome market hall right by my airbnb, Hala Mirowska. I grabbed a large rectangular pastry filled with cheese and spinach for breakfast. They had about 8 different kinds, and I want to try tme all.
The market hall. It was open every day and always full of people shopping.  I took a long walk to the reconstructed old town, and walked from its southernmost end up to the northernmost, then headed back south on a path along the river.

The train from Berlin to Warsaw was less than eventful. The train was direct, I had some music, and they were handing out free water. Couldn&rsquo;t be easier.
After a simple airbnb check-in, I scoped out a route to the tourist area full of restaurants I remembered from my previous trip, and headed out to find some dinner.
Poland has this concept called a &ldquo;milk bar&rdquo;. Originally serving dairy products, they now (and for a long time) serve all sorts of traditional polish foods &ndash; cabbage, potatoes, breaded fried pork cutlets, pierogi &ndash; at a crazy low, government-subsidized, cost.

I got to the bus station to buy a ticket, only to discover that the machine requires a certain MoBIB membership card, which you load trips on. Sounds more or less like an oyster card in london. Because of covid, buses aren&rsquo;t accepting cash. Frantically, with time ticking down, I attempted to register online for one of these cards. Once you register and order a card, you can start putting trips onto your account, and then ride.

I woke up feeling like something was off.
Not so much wanderlust as much as fernweh, despite being away from &ldquo;home&rdquo;. When I left the house last night for dinner, my hostess was watching tv on the couch. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that I&rsquo;m simply in a home that&rsquo;s bothering me. Which is a weird thing to contemplate.
I walked to the bastogne war museum. I thought it was about the battle of the bulge, but it covered the run up to WW2, starting with the end of WW1, and all the way through to the war&rsquo;s end.

Not much to say about today. I woke up around 8am. My destination was only 2 hours away, and the check-in time was 5pm.
I hung out at my &ldquo;campsite&rdquo; reading and watching &ldquo;no reservations&rdquo; until noon or so. I had three pints left over from the previous day, and I didn&rsquo;t want to bike with that with me. So there was some morning drinking.
The ride followed a &ldquo;pre&rdquo; ravel route.

I&rsquo;m returning to camping today. And biking. I&rsquo;ve literally only been away from it for two days, but the whole idea already seems weird. And I had been camping for two weeks.
Rain and storms are coming in the rest of the week, starting in a day or two. At great financial cost (comparatively .. 40EUR/night vs. camping for ~5EUR/night) I took a room in Bastogne for the remainder of the trip.

I woke up and had coffee in the airbnb. That was a delightful way to start the day. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting going back to camping, albeit for only one night.
I started considering my next residence after this bike trip. I was planning on Warsaw / Krakow, but actually a month rental in Paris is under 1000EUR, and pretty centrally located. It&rsquo;s definitely something to consider, but the cost of everything will be a lot more &ndash; probably 2-3x more than Poland.

First, Reims is pronounced like &ldquo;Raas&rdquo;. Or so. Knowing that would have been helpful when telling people where I was going. &ldquo;Remmes&rdquo;, as I had been pronouncing it, does not exist.
I had a very slow start to the day. My bus to Reims left at 15:27, and there wasn&rsquo;t much going on in CM on a saturday morning.
The bus to Reims was uneventful. I listened to, for the umpteenth time, Colour Haze&rsquo;s self-titled album.

The ride today was a non-event. It was 44km of, again, pristine paved voie verte. I reached my destination very quickly. Along the way I passed several little pillboxes facing north upriver. I&rsquo;m guessing it was to harass an attempt at nazi incursion into france.
At most soldiers stationed inside could have harried incoming transports. I'm guessing they were primarily there to inform of an invasion. By noon I was in Charleville-Mézière.

Today I was going to stay in the area and go for a hike. The river was flanked by fantastically forested hills, the sky was clear, and the temperature peaked at 24C (sweet, sweet respite).
The original path I looked at turned out to be for mountain bikes. And, at 20km, it was more than I wanted to hike on a day off.

Today was planned as an easy day. The voie verte route starts in Givet and passes right through Revin. In total, I was going to bike about 35km of the route to reach my destination.
Within about 20min of leaving, I rode past a guy with a touring setup similar to mine while he was having some water. A bit later I stopped to take a picture and he rolled past me.

I got up and packed. My breakfast was 3 belgian waffles and the remaining brown beer from Saint Monon.

I originally had scheduled 90 km for today. Then, upon seeing the high temp for the day (32C), I scaled it back to 50km. I arrived in Jemelle feeling good. I even did another 15km rountrip to get beer from Saint Monon Brewery, but now I can feel the ride.
I followed the EV5 bike route the entire way, an international European route. Well marked, well maintained, it was good riding.

After yesterday&rsquo;s complete rest day, I found a &ldquo;challenging&rdquo; hike in the area using komoot.
Either their algorithm for calculting difficulty is off (probable) or I&rsquo;ve gotten in a lot better shape (less likely). The 10-ish km I hiked were not challenging; I hardly broke a sweat. It was all in the forest, which was nice, but absent more than the occasional hilly view, not much was going on.

Corneal and Joke left before I woke up. They were super nice; I was bummed I didn&rsquo;t get to say goodbye.
The night before they told me to go to the tourist center and grab a RAVeL map, short for route à vélo longue. I had been following some of these routes without knowing it, and having an official map sounded like a good idea.
La Roche-en-Ardenne is such a cute town.

Astrotrain couldn&rsquo;t have been more right.
The day started well, despite a 9C night that woke me up cold. Tonight it will be cold again, but the nights get warmer after that. I&rsquo;ll try stuffing extra clothing into my sleeping bag tonight to keep warm. Like a hobo.1
My plan for today was to head to Saint-Hubert.

It rained several times in the night. Despite my inability as an outdoorsman, my tarp kept me dry. Except for waking up cold between 5am and 7am (cf. previous comment on bivouac sacks), I slept well.
I broke camp around 9:30am. I had only drunk two of the three beers from the previous night, so I had a Leffe with breakfast. Breakfast was a bit of peanut butter with some dried cranberries.
