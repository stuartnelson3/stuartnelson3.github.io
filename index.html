I had a tattoo appointment today.
On my tattoo selection I originally wanted a tattoo for my proposed trip to vietnam, which was meant to be happening at this point in time.1 As that trip had been scuttled and I still wanted a tattoo, I started looking through a best tattoo shop list for warsaw. I looked through dozens of artists' instagram pages.
I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted.

There&rsquo;s an awesome market hall right by my airbnb, Hala Mirowska. I grabbed a large rectangular pastry filled with cheese and spinach for breakfast. They had about 8 different kinds, and I want to try tme all.
The market hall. It was open every day and always full of people shopping.  I took a long walk to the reconstructed old town, and walked from its southernmost end up to the northernmost, then headed back south on a path along the river.

The train from Berlin to Warsaw was less than eventful. The train was direct, I had some music, and they were handing out free water. Couldn&rsquo;t be easier.
After a simple airbnb check-in, I scoped out a route to the tourist area full of restaurants I remembered from my previous trip, and headed out to find some dinner.
Poland has this concept called a &ldquo;milk bar&rdquo;. Originally serving dairy products, they now (and for a long time) serve all sorts of traditional polish foods &ndash; cabbage, potatoes, breaded fried pork cutlets, pierogi &ndash; at a crazy low, government-subsidized, cost.

I got to the bus station to buy a ticket, only to discover that the machine requires a certain MoBIB membership card, which you load trips on. Sounds more or less like an oyster card in london. Because of covid, buses aren&rsquo;t accepting cash. Frantically, with time ticking down, I attempted to register online for one of these cards. Once you register and order a card, you can start putting trips onto your account, and then ride.

I woke up feeling like something was off.
Not so much wanderlust as much as fernweh, despite being away from &ldquo;home&rdquo;. When I left the house last night for dinner, my hostess was watching tv on the couch. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fact that I&rsquo;m simply in a home that&rsquo;s bothering me. Which is a weird thing to contemplate.
I walked to the bastogne war museum. I thought it was about the battle of the bulge, but it covered the run up to WW2, starting with the end of WW1, and all the way through to the war&rsquo;s end.

Not much to say about today. I woke up around 8am. My destination was only 2 hours away, and the check-in time was 5pm.
I hung out at my &ldquo;campsite&rdquo; reading and watching &ldquo;no reservations&rdquo; until noon or so. I had three pints left over from the previous day, and I didn&rsquo;t want to bike with that with me. So there was some morning drinking.
The ride followed a &ldquo;pre&rdquo; ravel route.

I&rsquo;m returning to camping today. And biking. I&rsquo;ve literally only been away from it for two days, but the whole idea already seems weird. And I had been camping for two weeks.
Rain and storms are coming in the rest of the week, starting in a day or two. At great financial cost (comparatively .. 40EUR/night vs. camping for ~5EUR/night) I took a room in Bastogne for the remainder of the trip.

I woke up and had coffee in the airbnb. That was a delightful way to start the day. It&rsquo;s going to be interesting going back to camping, albeit for only one night.
I started considering my next residence after this bike trip. I was planning on Warsaw / Krakow, but actually a month rental in Paris is under 1000EUR, and pretty centrally located. It&rsquo;s definitely something to consider, but the cost of everything will be a lot more &ndash; probably 2-3x more than Poland.

First, Reims is pronounced like &ldquo;Raas&rdquo;. Or so. Knowing that would have been helpful when telling people where I was going. &ldquo;Remmes&rdquo;, as I had been pronouncing it, does not exist.
I had a very slow start to the day. My bus to Reims left at 15:27, and there wasn&rsquo;t much going on in CM on a saturday morning.
The bus to Reims was uneventful. I listened to, for the umpteenth time, Colour Haze&rsquo;s self-titled album.
